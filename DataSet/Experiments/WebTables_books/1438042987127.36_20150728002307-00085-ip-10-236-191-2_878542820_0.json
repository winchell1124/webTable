Carter\u0027s 25-year-old voice was already quite recognizable, although the improvising style on her 11 titles here is much more conservative than it would be from the 1970s on. However, Carter\u0027s scatting on \"Frenesi\" (which sounds like a wigged-out Carmen McRae) shows individuality, and her renditions of \"Social Call,\" \"I Could Write a Book,\" and \"Moonlight in Vermont\" are memorable. In addition, this CD has eight selections by Ray Bryant\u0027s trio with bassist Wendell Marshall and drummer Philly Joe Jones, a unit that also served as Carter\u0027s backup group on seven of her performances. A well-rounded and unclassifiable player who even at the beginning of his career mixed the drive and joy of swing with more advanced harmonies, Bryant was already long on his way toward developing his own sound in the mid-\u002750s. This version of \"Get Happy\" was previously unreleased, while \"Bryant\u0027s Folly\" (a rollicking blues) and \"Threesome\" are high points. A historic and enjoyable set.
