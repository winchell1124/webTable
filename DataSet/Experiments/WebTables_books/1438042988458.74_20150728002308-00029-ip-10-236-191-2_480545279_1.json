Conroy is a young ambitious teacher who ends up teaching on a small island off the cost of South Carolina, during the tumultuous time of desegregation. This is the story of his journey to help the children in his care to learn and grow in a way no one has ever done before. I couldn\u0027t give this book 4 stars because there were many parts where I felt that Conroy was too wordy, and I found myself skimming paragraphs, wishing he would just get on with his story already. As a life story I think this is a great one, as a book though, it was just good. ...more","review The one redeeming feature of this book, that was in fact quite good, was the beautiful alliteration. Russell has a way with words that is very picture The one redeeming feature of this book, that was in fact quite good, was the beautiful alliteration. Russell has a way with words that is very picturesque and eloquent. I loved the many ways she found to describe people and situations. She has quite a talent where this is concerned, in my opinion. And it was this alliteration that got me through the book. Other than the prose, I was not a fan of this book at all. This is the story of the Bigtree family, an alligator wrestling dynasty that lives deep in the swamps of southern Florida. The story takes place shortly after the children\u0027s mother dies, and takes us on the journey of their downfall as a business, and in my opinion as a family. This story just goes from bad to worse. The brother runs away to \"save the family\", the father leaves the two girls shortly after that, to go to the mainland on \"business matters\", leaving them alone on their island. The older sister is beginning to lose her mind and see ghosts, and no one sees anything wrong with leaving her alone on an island with a 13 year old girl, who is the youngest child in the family, and the main narrator of our story. There were definitely a couple of surprising twists, and it\u0027s certainly a tale of human nature that tells a story none could forget, and possibly very real. For those reasons, I\u0027m sure there will be fans of this book. My problem is this was such a sad and terrible story, and I was just so upset about how this family fell apart and abandoned each other. The book had an overall morbid tone that I did not enjoy at all. And when you add to that the fact that you\u0027re hearing about the events mainly from a 13 year old\u0027s perspective, complete with her imaginations and hallucinations, it\u0027s also slightly confusing. I honestly do not recommend this book. I found it difficult to stick with and the only reason I read it to completion is because it was a book club pick. ...more","review None","review A Soft Place to Land is a story about two half-sisters who are extremely close as children, but are separated after the death of their parents in a pl A Soft Place to Land is a story about two half-sisters who are extremely close as children, but are separated after the death of their parents in a plane crash. Forced to live on opposite sides of the country with families who have vastly differing parenting styles, the sisters sadly drift apart. The back cover promises more drama than is actually entailed throughout the story, and that sets you up for a bit of disappointment, because there is never any big shocker that turns things completely, it\u0027s just a slow evolution of the relationship between these two sisters. However, that\u0027s not to say this is a bad thing, it just wasn\u0027t advertised properly. This is a poignant story about a tragic event. Although I don\u0027t have a sister of my own, I still appreciated the relationship between these two and the challenges they faced. I also have to say that I LOVED the vivid descriptions of the Bay Area. Having recently moved here I am always hungry for more insight into places that people who call this place home remember fondly, or consider \"must see\" or favorites, along with what they consider overrated or touristy. I would read this book again just for that reason. Wonderful. ...more","review None","review I liked Savannah Breeze better than I liked Savannah Blues.

The situation made more sense to me - it was a bit of a stretch to me how she acquired the Breeze Inn and then it somehow got overlooked when everything else was taken from her, but I quickly got over that - and although I liked Weezie in Savannah Blues, I like BeBe better. She\u0027s more relatable to me as a character. I also liked Harry better than Daniel and how straightforward BeBe and Harry\u0027s relationship was. Comparisons aside, what really made this book for me was the mystery and action in this one. I LOVED the scenes in Ft Lauderdale and could not put my book down during that whole section. It was so fun watching BeBe get revenge and waiting to see how it would all play out. You do not need to read Savannah Blues to enjoy Savannah Breeze and although there are a few references to it, they are minor and don\u0027t detract from the reader\u0027s understanding or enjoyment of the story in any way. I recommend you skip Savannah Blues and jump straight into Savannah Breeze instead. ...more","review I liked Deep Dish so much that I really expected more from this one.

I can not imagine living in the South in the 60\u0027s, and I think Jackson, MS would have been one of the worst places to be at that time. Stockett did a wonderful job portraying what it must have been like though, and I think she portrayed several sides of the story quite well, creating a full picture, while telling one story. The writing style reminded me a bit of another of my favorite writers, Jodi Picout. I love the added author\u0027s note at the end about Stockett\u0027s own experience and felt it added just that extra bit of credibility to the story, made her a bit like Skeeter in that aspect.

If the people who started wars didn’t make them sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight? But, no matter what rallying cries the orators give to the idiots who fight, no matter what noble purposes they assign to wars, there is never but one reason for a war. And that is money. All wars are in reality money squabbles. But so few people ever realize it. Their ears are too full of bugles and drums and the fine words from stay-at-home orators. Sometimes the rallying cry is ’save the Tomb of Christ from the Heathen!�? Sometimes it’s ’down with Popery!�? and sometimes ‘Liberty!�? and sometimes ‘Cotton, Slavery and States�? Rights!\" -Rhett Butler \"Dear Scarlett! You aren\u0027t helpless. Anyone as selfish and determined as you are is never helpless. God help the Yankees if they should get you.\" -Rhett Butler \"No, I don\u0027t think I will kiss you, although you need kissing, badly. That\u0027s what\u0027s wrong with you. You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.\" -Rhett Butler \"Child, it\u0027s a very bad thing for a woman to face the worst that can happen to her, because after she\u0027s faced the worst she can\u0027t ever really fear anything again. ....Scarlett, always save something to fear - even as you save something to love....\" -Grandma Fontaine to Scarlett \"In the end what will happen will be what has happened whenever a civilization breaks up. The people who have brains and courage come through and the ones who haven\u0027t are winnowed out. At least, it has been interesting, if not comfortable, to witness a Gotterdammerung. A what? A dusk of the gods. Unfortunately, we Southerners did think we were gods.\" -Ashley to Scarlett \"Make up your mind to this. If you are different, you are isolated, not only from people of your own age but from those of your parents\u0027 generation and from your children\u0027s generation too. They\u0027ll never understand you and they\u0027ll be shocked no matter what you do. But your grandparents would probably be proud of you and say: \u0027Theres a chip off the old block,\u0027 and your grandchildren will sigh enviously and say: \u0027What an old rip Grandma must have been!\u0027 and they\u0027ll try to be like you.\" -Rhett to Scarlett \"I loved something I made up, something that\u0027s just as dead as Melly is.

And I never ceased to be amazed at how everything Ignatious touched ended up in disaster. However, I\u0027m not sure I agree with the reviews on the back cover stating how hilarious this book is. I realize it was meant to be a satire, but I guess the characters seemed so realistic to me that I mostly found this book sad. I think this was really well written regarding the character development and found I could clearly picture all the players in the story and understand their situation quite well. I also really liked how everything came together in the end, with the exception of what happens to Ignatius himself (I thought that should have ended differently). The problem for me was Ignatius is not someone you want to picture or know very well. He is totally disgusting. There is nothing about him that is likeable at all and although I realize that is the point, it still made the story hard to read. I just couldn\u0027t stand to hear about any more destruction caused by him and his warped, self-righteous, sense of right and wrong, or about his valve and yellow sheets. I am glad I read this book because it\u0027s so popular and I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I do think Toole was a good writer and would have read more by him if he had written more. This just simply was not my style, Ignatius was too gross. ...more","review I read this book in high school and remember really liking it.
