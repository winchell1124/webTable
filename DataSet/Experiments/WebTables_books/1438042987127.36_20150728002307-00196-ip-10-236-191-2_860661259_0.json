When its predecessor opened to $75 million four years ago. This is the predicament facing ‘Star Trek Into Darkness,�? which opened at number one at box office while being something of a disappointment.

Many movies would kill for a $70 million. Heck, 2002′s ‘Star Trek: Nemesis�? would have killed for a $70 million total. But when it comes to summer blockbusters, the sequel always has to be bigger and more expensive than the last. ‘Star Trek Into Darkness�? was not an inexpensive film and the studio was hoping for that opening weekend number to be at least $20 million higher than that. To add insult to injury, the film made less than the first ‘Star Trek�? even after you factor in additional 3D and IMAX costs. The technical term for that is “a knee to the nuts,�? but don’t quote us on that. Not even a Thursday release could pump these numbers up �? the total gross after four days is only $84 million. What does this mean for ‘Star Trek Into Darkness�? and the ‘Star Trek�? franchise as a whole? It means that this outing of the Enterprise crew probably won’t match the $257 million made by the first film. It also means that ‘Star Trek 3�? (which will still probably happen) will be considerably smaller and less expensive than the first two. Considering how many fans have reacted to this film, that may actually b a good thing in the long run. While ‘Star Trek Into Darknes�? stumbled, ‘Iron Man 3�? continued to do what ‘Iron Man�? movies do: make a ton of money. The superhero adventure grossed $35 million in","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0}
