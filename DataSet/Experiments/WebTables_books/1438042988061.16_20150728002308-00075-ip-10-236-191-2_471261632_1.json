I could give you a basic plot outline, to start with, I suppose. Catherine\u0027s secret lover, also a coworker, dies. She is unable to grieve outwardly (secret) and her sympathetic boss - who may also have a crush on her - arranges for her to work on a project away from her usual workplace. She becomes obsessively involved in the project and completes it. The end. This basic outline will tell you absolutely nothing about what this story is really about, and I\u0027m not entirely sure I can tell you either. It\u0027s probably about loss, fear of loss, obsession, fear of obsession, the mysteries of human interaction and perhaps even physics. Did Mr. Carey indulge in an intensive study of German transcendentalists before writing this book? I have questions. I found Catherine to be an unsympathetic character and felt very out of patience with her behavior. I did relate on some level to her throwing herself into a difficult project in order to escape from her grief. I don\u0027t really have anything else to offer here. It wasn\u0027t a terrible book. It was even beautiful in spots, but then, rotten in spots too. It\u0027s an odd little book.

I loved how the story began with Claire\u0027s 7th birthday and then moved backward through time to her birth and then circled back to her 7th birthday again. I especially loved the images of waves and animals and events in the sea that were used to illustrate stories of love, birth, death and loss. There really is something different about the relationship of island people to the sea. The other girls didn\u0027t always like this song because it was not a real wonn song. It was a fisherman\u0027s song. Although the melody was cheerful, the words were sad. You never got back things that fell into the sea.

This is basically a self-help book. Geneen Roth runs retreats for women who are trying to lose weight. The thing that\u0027s different about her is that she\u0027s not all about the diet. She\u0027s all about helping people figure out what it is they are trying to hide from or numb. The idea is that obsessive eating is no different from alcoholism or drug abuse. It\u0027s just another way of self-medicating. Therefore, even if a woman diets away all the weight she wants to, she will not have solved the underlying problem, whatever it is. I found it applicable to life in general - particularly the chapter about \"The Voice\" in our heads. It\u0027s that Freudian construct from childhood where we take all the voices of authority and merge them into one Voice. The problem is that sometimes that voice tells us things that aren\u0027t true. As adults, we are meant to be able to sort truth from fiction, but we aren\u0027t always successful.

A recently discharged soldier who lost his eye while attempting to recover an artifact stolen by the Nazi\u0027s from Egypt returns to his job as a professor at Princeton. Amazingly enough, the mysterious artifact also arrives in Princeton and the soldier turned professor is enlisted to study it and determine why the Nazis found it important and whether it might be useful to the war effort. When the artifact - a sarcophagus - is opened, evil forces are unleashed on the world. Occasionally even a page turner, this was a fun read.

This is a short dystopian novel which takes Agenda 21 to it\u0027s imagined worst case scenario of implementation in which humans are relegated to small settlements in order to minimize the impact of humans on the environment. People are assigned sections, mates and work, including a quota of energy production. Food and water is rationed.

It is historical in the sense that the locations and many of the major players are historical.

Really, it\u0027s a pretty high quality historical romance. It\u0027s well written and full of adventure and drama. Last Train from Cuernavaca is a love story in a war setting. The main love story is between the English (la Inglesa) owner of a hotel in Cuernavaca and a soldier in the Mexican Army. There is another pair, a young revolutionary couple, who fight for Zapata. Through the adventures and misadventures of the couples, this novel does a great job giving a sense of how the Revolution affected people\u0027s lives. It also portrays some harsh truths about war. In the Mexican Revolution, most of the fighting was over political power and there was very little concern for people\u0027s lives or property. ...more","review These books continue to surprise me with their ability to pull me in and keep me interested.

It is a story of how literature can take us out of a place and into another place, no matter where we are or who we are. It\u0027s about how stories help us relate to one another. It is also a story of war and fear and survival. It is well written and thoughtful. The only complaint I have is that there was no real sense of place. It\u0027s vaguely Papua New Guinea, but also not positively there. The author may have wanted to avoid commenting on any specific place or situation, which is fine, but I struggle a little when I can\u0027t solidly plant the feet of my imagination in a Place. Quotes: By the time Mr.Watts reached the end of chapter one I felt like I had been spoken to by this boy Pip. This boy who I couldn\u0027t see to touch but knew by ear. I had found a new friend. The surprising thing is where I\u0027d found him - not up a tree or sulking in the shade, or splashing around in one of the hill streams, but in a book. No one had told us kids to look there for a friend. Or that you could slip inside the skin of another. A doctor would have said I was suffering from depression. Everything I have read since suggests this was the case. But when you are in the grip of something like that it doesn\u0027t usually announce itself. No. What happens is you sit in a dark, dark cave and you wait. If you are lucky there is a pinprick of light, and if you are especially lucky that pinprick will grow larger and larger, until one day the cave appears to slip behind, and just like that you find yourself in daylight and free. This is how it happened for me. ...more","review This was a Kindle first selection from a few months ago.

The characters are introduced and the conflict is established. This part of the story is interesting and I quite enjoyed it. The second half of the story moves several of the characters from France to Colorado Springs, USA. From here things just get weird. All the essentials for creating a creepy ghost are there, but it just doesn\u0027t ring true to the character development of the first part of the book. The characters involved either become super creepy overnight, with a sudden revelation of a previously hidden aspect of their character, or they become super depressed and hopeless due to a rapid destruction of all possible alternatives.

For, me, I just couldn\u0027t get my head into it, which is often the case for me and science fiction, so I can\u0027t fairly blame it on Mr. Ihimaera. The last story \"meeting elizabeth costello\", was inspired by the novel [Elizabeth Costello]. This story was my second favorite. It\u0027s really a bit of a rant about indigenous writing and the \"colonization\" of literature by old Englishmen. I may not totally agree, but it was fun reading. My favorite quote came from this story, but it\u0027s Mr. Ihimaera quoting another author: The African writer, Nobel prizewinner Chinua Achebe, commenting on these outside perspectives, said at the beginning of his career, \"It dawned on me that although fiction was undoubtedly fictitious, it could also either be true or false.\" - and he was right. ...more","review **WARNING** This is going to be a long review. Apologies in advance. :) [American Places] is a collection of thirteen essays, eight by [Wallace Stegner **WARNING** This is going to be a long review. Apologies in advance. :) [American Places] is a collection of thirteen essays, eight by [Wallace Stegner] and 4 by his son [Page Stegner] and one they wrote together. The essays celebrate the beauties of America, its varying geography and fascinating history. At the same time, they are heavily apologist, decrying the \"conquering spirit\" of the immigrants and their pillaging of the land and its resources. At first glance, Mr. Stegner and his son seem very similar in their attitude and environmentalism. I did note some interesting differences. Wallace writes in pictures. His prose is lyrical and evokes memories of place and a desire to see the things he has seen. While Wallace is a bit curmudgeonly and grumpily complains about the desecration of his beloved wildernesses, his love for the country shines through. In the essay \"The River\", which made me want to embark on a river boat cruise immediately, Stegner writes: Creator, destroyer, highway, sewer, the Mississippi is also a dream and a myth. For a time it imposed itself as a boundary across the flow of America\u0027s westward movement; briefly, it seemed a line at which settlement might stop, or at least pause. then almost at once its tributary the Missouri, and its tributary the Platte, led the nation on west. The Mississippi stayed put, generating its own north-south dream that was made immortal in [Huckleberry Finn]. Europe troubles the East Coast, Asia troubles the West, but nothing troubles the Mississippi. Page writes a little less lyrically and a little more loosely, but still skillfully and with fondness for the American places. He discusses questions on both sides - whether it\u0027s possible to find a balance between growth and sustainability. In addition, he brings up some of the vital questions about the consequences of the social revolution of the 1960\u0027s and where it leaves things 25 years later. In \"Life Along the Fault Line\", Page writes: The concept of an individual\u0027s civil rights began to eclipse the assumption of community standards of behavior. Much of the new permissiveness was long overdue, and if it inspired people to go out and stump for everything from prison reform to nude sunbathing, the world was probably a better place for it. But for a few people it seems that public restraints were the only measure of personal restraint, and as the lid came off, some subtle, and finally not so subtle, changes began to occur... The \"oppressed\" had become the oppressors. In \"The Redwood Curtain\", Page writes about the cultural divide he saw in Humboldt county. Loggers, whose life depends on the continuance of the lumber business and the younger \"hipper\" citizens who moved to the area to attend Humboldt University and liked it and stayed. It is the conflict between: ...growth is not necessarily progress, that less is often more... and the fact that (the loggers) are concerned with beans on the table and a roof over the kids\u0027 heads, not metaphysics. \"There It Is: Take It\" had the most personal impact on me. This essay covers the history of the Los Angeles aqueduct and the federal government\u0027s (Teddy Roosevelt\u0027s) decision that \"the interests of the few must unfortunately be disregarded in view of the infinitely greater interest to be served by putting the water in Los Angeles.\" The long term effects of this decision include the near emptying of Mono Lake, the drying up of springs and loss of native vegetation leading to dust storms, artesian wells drying and then the ground water at risk. The disregard of the needs of the Owens Valley and the long term effects on the entire ecosystem to feed the insatiable greed Los Angeles had for water was a subtext of my childhood. I grew up near Los Angeles. My water came on the aqueduct. Water conservation and drought, water rights and limitation of growth were subjects any kid over the age of 10 could discuss with some intelligence. \"Save Mono Lake\" bumper stickers were prevalent in the Bay area in the early 90\u0027s when we went to Berkeley for graduate school, and finally after more than a decade of litigation, Mono Lake and its tributaries were finally protected. Here\u0027s the conflict. The water shouldn\u0027t have been given exclusively to Los Angeles. The resources of the Owens Valley and other parts of the west should not have been preempted by the needs of a population so far away that the consequences of their wanton use of water were invisible. I fully understand the objection of the citizens who sued to regain some of their water rights. On the other hand, those that lobby for the environment can do just as much damage, whether intentional or not. For an example, have a look at the water wars fought in Northern California over the last decade between farmers and environmentalists trying to save the delta smelt, a fish that will probably go extinct anyway. Is the loss of property and untold acres of fruit and nut trees worth it? And now that those orchards are gone and dry, and only empty, dusty fields remain, what will be the environmental impact of that? It\u0027s not zero. Man, the great creator and destroyer of environments, is also part of what he creates or destroys, and rises and falls with it. In the West, water is life. From the very beginning, when people killed each other with shovels over the flow of a primitive ditch, down to the present, when cities kill each other for precisely the same reasons and with the same self-justifications, water is the basis for western growth, western industry, western communities. As Page says, only a policy made with the wisdom of Solomon might be capable of both protecting rights of communities and conserving the country we love. ...more","review None","review None","review None","review A clever and creative tale of a visionary rabbit who leads a group of intrepid rabbits on a long journey to a new home.
