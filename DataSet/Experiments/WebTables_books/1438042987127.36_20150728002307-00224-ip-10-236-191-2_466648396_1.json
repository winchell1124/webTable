Since one of my life questions to myself when a social, character building decision needs to be made Is...\"What would Grace Kelly do?\" Readers will enjoy this book because it does not dwell on her flawless delicate looks. You learn she wore glasses, paid for her own education even though she was a blue blood in real life. Grace always worked, followed social decorum with a flair of being a rebel, and was not able to win her own fathers approval on anything through her entire life. I admired Grace for not getting mental about the fact her father slighted her. He would not acknowledge his daughter did indeed pocess greatness loaded with talent. Grace\u0027s love life is intresting. The fact she married a Prince and how she married a Prince is worth the read. I also read this book because I wanted to be clued into her death that was so tragic. I learned why the car accident happened and the degree of love she actually had for her husband. Grace Kelly is a private person so if you want to know her as a person you need to sit with this book. I enjoyed and felt a better connection to the Great Grace Kelly. ...more","review by chapter 3 I knew Who I suspected \u0027did it\u0027.

What made this book enjoyable reading is that it delivered, mystery,suspense, court room trial, unique but highly believable characters, Mothers POV Dad POV, and as the title implys an excellent Child\u0027s POV, a slime ball Husband POV, and a Grandmothers POV. While it may seem like too many POV\u0027s as the reader you don\u0027t actually realize all these POV\u0027s are there...till you have finished the book and then you realize the gift Richard North Patterson has for weaving all this in. The story line flows beautifully and if you enjoy Justice trial scenes you are hooked. I was correct in who I suspected \"did it\" but the author is very successful in throwing you off gently during the course of the book. The court room stragety, and conversations are especially clever, and intresting. Richard North Patterson has the right background and connections to write these best sellers. I think this book was written 15 years ago and still stands the test of time. ...more","review OK a lot of this rang true.. things you do without realizing to be imaginative when all you thought you were doing was getting away or just doing some OK a lot of this rang true.. things you do without realizing to be imaginative when all you thought you were doing was getting away or just doing something you enjoyed,,, now the bathroom conversations being centralized did not surprise me. look if major profit making companies design their culture to have this why should I question it think about it. Brain storming sessions don\u0027t work unless they are arranged properly? but the problem is you can\u0027t design a brain storming session that works. This is true in mm opinion.. You can design trips that inspire new thinking but throwing people in a room won\u0027t work. This i agree with. I do consider myself to be on the imaginative side so this book would only enforce what I suspected. I only gave it three stars for this reason.

Admittedly the best part of the book was the first 3/4. For me the ending was OK but not up to the emotional place it truly take you. Several reviewers said they found Maryann a little cold and unfeeling. Those reviews came from men. As a woman/lady I found Maryann loaded with compassion, her past fascinating and how she tied into the main character writing the book (we never get his name)compelling. The book is titled well and as for the author getting a huge advance because everything was over the top (oh Yes everything)I can see why he commanded big bucks. This book takes you through, fire, hell,hospitals,drug addiction, vivid paranormal experiences that literally have you feeling you can reach out and touch what is happening. The depth, history, loyalty to beliefs is worth the read. I am not going to say this was an easy read, or a difficult read lets just say I had quite the adventure the author intends for us to have. This book is beyond a reading experience ... visually we are allowed to be taken back in time, feel the bravery,the heat, the love, the education and jump in. I will not forget this book. ...more","review This book touches your memory. Your memories shape who you are. Me personally I enjoyed the main character in MOST ways portrayed.

Way too tragic for the hopefulness you were strung out to believe. The ending is wacked out in my opinion and could have been done as well as the first 3/4 of the book. Even for Anne Rivers Siddons the ending was crazy. Ive read and enjoyed other books by this author, which is why I wanted to read this. This authors writing is exceptional portrayal of southern upbringing and beautiful strong women.

John Edwards flaw was knowing he had wronged his family, the country, and his campaign and he thought he was bullet proof. Elizabeth was not as innocent as the news made her out to be however she was always loyal to her family. I don\u0027t see any way John Edwards can climb out of his devotion to \"ms Hunter\" the baby mama.

James Stein explains elements of decisions. Many times math is involved other times a decision making approach is used. If you read Blink or tipping point you might as well add this one to the mix. James Stein does a good job without not talking over anyone\u0027s head or dragging something out. Anyone can better their decision process after reading this. ...more","review Emily griffin is still a contender for high society laughs. I wanted to give this book 3 stars and will continue to read all the other books by this a Emily griffin is still a contender for high society laughs. I wanted to give this book 3 stars and will continue to read all the other books by this author. The personality for the main character was dead on likable with hope, portrayed as dumb and brilliantly funny. I compared this book to others she has written and feel I was to harsh on this review. Emily Griffin has an element that that no one but her can capture in a book. She is up there with the Bridget Jones Diary books... for those of you who have read and think funny. These are not serious books just the right stuff to bring laughter. ...more","review A decent story,,, just too sappy with fluff,, which I did not expect from N. Sparks. The author does a visual job on presenting Raleigh, Duke, New Ber A decent story,,, just too sappy with fluff,, which I did not expect from N. Sparks. The author does a visual job on presenting Raleigh, Duke, New Bern and the state of North Carolina. I felt the material was dull and boring. Just my opinion this book would be best enjoyed by someone at least 70 years old. While the characters are young and have borderline passion it cannot compete with \"the Notebook\". This book was written to complement that book. \"The wedding\" is just page after page Sap and disappointment. ...more","review I will read this author again. Can\u0027t really recommend this particular book to start a Dalgliesh series. Way too many Characters so there is no chance I will read this author again. Can\u0027t really recommend this particular book to start a Dalgliesh series. Way too many Characters so there is no chance in getting attached to one character. The description from the author has you feeling you are right in England, shady days and all. I don\u0027t think the sun came out once in this book. Her descriptions are 5 star but I must admit I was drawing stick people in a little note book to keep up with all the suspects and characters. I thought the ending was whacked out. Great for all those that could take 560 pages to get to this ending. One of the other reviewers reccommend starting with \"the murder room\". I will try PD James again I am giving it 3 stars for the complete success the author has in taking you to England. My review before I trudged through 560 pages.... I must have missed the boat not to have learned about this author before. The view of England, all the etiquette, polished manners people put forth and of course a dead body with a note. I am really enjoying this I just stumbled upon it at the library it was a staff person recommend. ...more","review These girls kept their friendships and lives going over classic novels. to see friends pushed away, kept in the dark, share food, keep secrets, and lov These girls kept their friendships and lives going over classic novels. to see friends pushed away, kept in the dark, share food, keep secrets, and love one another for who they authentically are. I\u0027d say this is what keeps great friendships alive. The author shows each of us not to be lead down the grass is greener road, take the journey, you are not alone. Surprise yourself by making your choices pan out. If you did not care for the actual book Anna Karenina I am not sure you will enjoy this book. ...more","review Since I am facinated with the Opera, \"Madam Butterfly\" I took a chance on this book. I would compair this book to \"The Good Earth\" by Pearl Buck. The Since I am facinated with the Opera, \"Madam Butterfly\" I took a chance on this book. I would compair this book to \"The Good Earth\" by Pearl Buck. The events unfold for the family so you become invested in each Character\u0027s motive\u0027s and survivial. I especially enjoyed the way the author incorporated \"Opera\" in the story so that whatever your intrest level for Opera ...you understand the beauty of Opera and Opera is no longer complicated. If you enjoyed \"The Good Earth\" , \"Butterfly\u0027s Child\", will be a good read. ...more","review You will view architects totally differently after reading this book.

What a classic and I felt I could see the buildings. All the characters are genuinely passionate about their work. It\u0027s Brilliant how the love interest and the publisher share their love of talent. It\u0027s unpredictable what will make you cry. This is a classic read.You will feel the era and the beauty behind everything. Right down to the lust, unique power drive, and love triangle. ...more","review This is one of those books you think is boring then you find yourself going in the direction this book encourages.

I learned to accept gifts you have, let others question. The people that do not question are usually intellegent , sensitve, and most important genuienly happy. Feels good when you get to \"the calling\". Lots of struggle for me (the journey to get to the calling). Pieces adhere to your subconscious and boom one day you arrive. ...more","review I know, I know the world loved it. i met the publishers and they are amazing. So I cannot pick a best seller.

I was not happy with certain developments of the main character. Most people I talked to felt this book offered hope and a happy ending with a great story. YES it is a great story I don\u0027t see the happy love story about this book. Millions of reader\u0027s can\u0027t be wrong. It needs to be read just have open expectations. ...more","review this was a different kind of book for me. I almost gave this book 1 more star for the incrediable ending.

However I also had to knock off a star for some of the stunts the author had the main character woman engaging. I did not find that believeable. There are several remarkable children that entertwine as characters which I found refreshing. The story is not over the top and provides the reader with intresting page turning. ...more","review funny, if you want a happy ending and must have a perfect happy ending,, add this to you reading list,, easy read no stress. The Beaver character remi funny, if you want a happy ending and must have a perfect happy ending,, add this to you reading list,, easy read no stress. The Beaver character reminded me of my friend Beth. And Beth definitely wants a happy ending. Beth makes me laugh and this book had me smiling. Probably too sappy for classic book fans but I found nothing wrong with this book. Youth, Rock and Roll, Beauty, handsome, country, city it has it all. ...more","review Master piece.

It\u0027s been out for a while and I dismissed it as just a \"new phase best seller\". If you are a happy person and lean toward attracting energy you will enjoy and benefit from this book. If you know you are a critical person, just enjoy complaining and being a victim this book will not help you. I do not think this book offends any religion and can help your prayers. ...more","review Mississippi law does make me smile. You can feel the southern roots right to your bones.
