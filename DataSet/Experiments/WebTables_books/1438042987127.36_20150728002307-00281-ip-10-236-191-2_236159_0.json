Last week, a little magician thriller handily derailed a Will Smith juggernaut and this week, the tiny horror film ‘The Purge�? took ‘The Internship�? down a peg or a dozen. We’re one month in and this summer movie season has already given us plenty of surprises at the box office.

First of all, it’s a horror movie opening in the middle of blockbuster season, which means it had a lot of competition from superheroes and action stars. Second, it’s R-rated, which severely limits the number of people who were able to see it. Finally, it only cost $3 million, which means that a modest opening would have been a huge victory. So, $36 million? That’s huge. That enormous. That’s proof that a properly marketed R-rated horror film can open big in the same month as a Superman movie. That’s impressive stuff. ‘The Purge�? bumped ‘Fast and Furious 6�? out of the number one spot, but the well-liked action flick has nothing to be worried about. With a weekend total of $19 million and a current gross of $202 million, it’s already one of the biggest hits of the year and will become the highest grossing film in the franchise by next week. Audiences love this series and the buzz has been almost unanimously positive, so it may even have a shot at $250 million at this rate. In third place, ‘Now You See Me�? continued to exceed expectations, grossing $19 million (taking only a small drop from last week) for a $61 million total. At this rate, $100 million is looking likely and the project should start turning a profit by sometime","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0}
