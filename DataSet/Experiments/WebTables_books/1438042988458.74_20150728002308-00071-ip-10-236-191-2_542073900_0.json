Just \u0027cuz the weather began gusting up the shivers, we here at RSST GotchadoubleSKAvered this week. The sunny Ob-La-Di gets a bedrock ska treatment from (uh, who else...?) The Bedrocks, followed up with one of Australia\u0027s finest, Gabriella Cilmi (chill me). Actually, she\u0027ll warm you up quite nicely. The twin Ob-Las were sandwiched between a set of double-shots (Toots, Giuliano Palma and TSPO with two apiece) and an all-TC 4(+2)-in-a-row. In orbit around Sherwood\u0027s Planet, Mr. Funn discovers the AIMToronto Orchestra, kicking off a set that veers from Jackie Mittoo and Okapi with Aldo Kapi\u0027s Orchestra to Taro Hakase\u0027s Wonder-ful Stevie cover, Tuatara visiting the Land of Oz (and we mean Oz, not Australia!) Alfredo Rodriguez making a Difference, Shiina Ringo doing what nobody does better, Artie Shaw Stopping \u0027n\u0027 Going and YMCK Socopogogo-ing. And, of course, check out the Ooh as it effortlessly shifts gears from Tea For Two to Cocktails For Two.
