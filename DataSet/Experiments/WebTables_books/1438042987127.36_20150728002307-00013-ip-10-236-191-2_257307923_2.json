The later editions of the specification incorporate the changes dictated by the errata documents. The new versio XML 1.1 was published as a Recommendation in February 2004. The major changes in the new version concern the Unicode character code and its use in XML names. Versioning of the Unicode specification had caused problems in character encoding of XML 1.0 names because the characters in XML 1.0 names were restricted to characters in Unicode 2. In XML 1.1 the syntax of names is specified to allow future changes in Unicode. The list below shows XML specifications published as Recommendations so far., 32342\u003dThe development of XML Fragment Interchange seems to have freezed.The Candidate Recommendation is from year 2001. The language is intended to provide capabilities to specify a part of a whole XML document as a fragment to be sent to a receiver., 72372\u003dTable 4 lists the languages developed to enable Web publishing using XML. XHMTL is a reformulation of HTML 4 in XML 1.0. The original XHMTL language has later been modularized and the minimal set of modules required is defined in XHTML Basic. XForms is a language to support the use of interactive forms on the Web. X-Forms can be integrated to other markup languages, such as XMTML, but also to others. XHTML-Print is a member in the module-based XHTML family languages. It provides a simple page description format for low-cost printers. In October W3C published a new version of HTML called HTML5 with new features to support Web application authors and interoperability. The specification defines an abstract language and memory presentation called \"DOM HTML\". The specification also defines two concrete syntaxes for the language, one being the HTML syntax and the other the XHTML syntax. The XHTML syntax of HTML5 is called XHTML5. Table 4. XML Applications for Web Publishing, 10776\u003dThe XML development started in 1996. The use of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) as the publishing language of the Internet had quickly expanded in the beginning of 1990’s. There was a need to find an agreement about a generic markup language straightforwardly usable over the Internet. SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), published as an ISO standard in 1986, had been widely accepted as a generic markup language for digital documents, but the large collection of rules in SGML and the number of different optional features caused problems in the implementation and utilization of SGML. A goal in the XML development was to restrict the rules of SGML and thus to ease the writing of programs for processing documents., 30289\u003dCSS is a language for specifying style sheets for any structured documents. It has been defined on three levels that build on the previous. CSS level 1 CSS1 published as a Recommendation in 1996 was developed especially for HTML documents. In developing CSS level 2, XML as a notation for structured documents was taken especially into account. Both CSS1 and CSS2 were defined in one Recommendation document. For level 3 instead there is not a single specification document. Level 3 consists of modules built on level 2. Another language for rendering XML documents is XSL. It is a style sheet language especially designed for XML documents. It uses XML syntax for style sheets. XSL contains the transformation language XSLT as its component. XSLT can be used also independently of XSL to describe transformations of XML documents.}","lastModified":"Mon, 01 Dec 2014 14:05:27 GMT","textBeforeTable":"font-family:Arial\"\u003eTable 1.
