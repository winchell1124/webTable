She was unable to attend the movie\u0027s premiere because it was held at a whites-only theater.[1] McQueen also had a role on the controversial Beulah radio show.[2] Often typecast as a maid, she said: \"I didn\u0027t mind playing a maid the first time, because I thought that was how you got into the business. But after I did the same thing over and over, I resented it. I didn\u0027t mind being funny, but I didn\u0027t like being stupid.\"[1], 6527\u003dBorn Thelma McQueen in Tampa, Florida on January 7, 1911, she planned to become a nurse until a high school teacher suggested that she try acting.

She appeared in an uncredited role in Mildred Pierce (1945) (where she had a good amount of screen time) and played a supporting role in Duel in the Sun (1946). By 1947, she had grown tired of the ethnic stereotypes she was required to play and ended her film career., 15973\u003dMcQueen died at age 84 on December 22, 1995 at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, from burns sustained when a kerosene heater she attempted to light malfunctioned and burst into flames.[13], 22446\u003dButterfly McQueen Remembered by Stephen Bourne 2008, 10055\u003dFrom 1950 until 1952 she played Oriole, another racially stereotyped role, on the television series Beulah.
