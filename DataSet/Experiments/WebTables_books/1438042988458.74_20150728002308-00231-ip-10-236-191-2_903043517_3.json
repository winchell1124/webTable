Be sure to join #kde-bugs on irc.freenode.net, as this is where the bug-day will be coordinated. (You can even join now!) The goal of this bug-day is to check for: simple step-by-step instructions, reproducibility, and most of all, come up with test-cases for reproducing the bugs. This will enable the Konqueror developers to deal with bugs more easily, and so have more time left to actually fix them. When you have added either a test-case or step-by-step instructions for the reproduction of a bug, please list it in the appropriate section below, so that a second triager can see if they can get your instructions/test-case to work correctly. This page provides an excellent explanation of how to create a test-case. This page also has useful information on how to not mis-mark bugs. In particular, \"duplicates are hard\". Konqueror doesn\u0027t have as many duplicates as some applications, and we don\u0027t want to claim things are duplicates when they aren\u0027t. So do not look too hard for them, and make sure to double check them with someone else, preferably one of the developers before marking/closing.We especially don\u0027t want to create more work for developers!","textAfterTable":"joselb 3.5.9 and kubuntu 4.0.4 with qt4.4 ecki 3.5.9 and svn trunk r808533 (qt4.4 final) bala Debian, 4:4.0.68+svn794641 jael kubuntu 4.0.4 with qt4.4 xsacha Windows Server 2008 with KDE 4.0.73 and qt4.4 henrikmidtiby Ubuntu 8.04 with KDE 4.0.3 Blauzahl 4.0 branch r802901   Tip Please be sure to sign every bug or comment you add to this page with your irc nickname.
