Start a new Search If you can\u0027t find a baby, it may be that the parents have opted out of having their newborn\u0027s information shared online. Oftentimes, the infant\u0027s name has just been misspelled. If you are unsure of the spelling, click on Show Me All The Babies to see a roll count of babies born within the last two months at Sanford hospitals. For participating parents, information about babies is posted Monday through Friday by noon. Babies born after 1 pm on Friday will be posted on Monday. Babies are online approximately two days after being born. We understand your eagerness to see the new little one, but please keep in mind that babies often have other priorities and we always ensure that they have the care and attention they need during this time.","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":2,"headerRowIndex":0}
