There\u0027s a LiveCD which contains a snapshot of trunk which you can use here: http://susegallery.com/a/LpcWmF/bugsquad-live-cd. It\u0027s still somewhat untested. Ping Lemma on IRC if you\u0027re having trouble. Be sure to join #kde-bugs on irc.freenode.net, as this is where the bug-day will be coordinated. (You can even join now!) Some more information on how to mark bugs can be found on This page. Some bugs may not be reproducible on every installation of KDE. Thus we use a 4-eye principle, having at least 2 triagers look at the bugs before we make any changes on the bugs themselves. Some bugs will only be reprocudible on certain graphics hardware, so please always provide the graphics card and driver you are using. If a bug\u0027s description is somewhat unclear, try to provide a better step-by-step procedure on how to reproduce it. This will make it easier for developers to find and fix the bug. Check if bugs reported for KWin which are previously UNCONFIRMED are reproducible. Check for duplicates of newer bugs (\u003e\u003d version 2.4) Check if bugs reported for older versions of KWin (\u003c\u003d version","textAfterTable":"IRC Nickname KDE version used for testing Graphics hardware FiNeX KDE 4.5.2, ArchLinux GeForce 9600 GT, nvidia 256.53,mesa 7.8.2 jtamate svn trunk r1184129 OpenSuse r300 free driver,Gallium 0.4 on RV350, 2.1 Mesa 7.9 Lemma svn trunk r1184315 NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GTS, 256.35   Tip If you\u0027re unsure about your graphics card or driver, you can use the glxinfo command in konsole to figure it out.
