If you have bought from me in the past I might have something for you. I have always had a soft spot for the boys and have always tried to place nice wethers in homes that would appreciate them, but since this has proven a futile thing I will no longer off this option. Too often the goats are not cared for properly and too many new owners do not understand  what is involved. It is a shame because I think wethers are great for spinner flocks.  Please do not contact me for a wether unless you are a previous customer in good standing.   Seville:  White buck (born light red), registered through CAGBA Seville is a long bodied buck with excellent fleece. Both his parents were winning show goats. His sire was a very big, very dark red buck that was much sought after when I was showing him. His dam is my best goat and she throws kids with outstanding fleece. He is a special buck with a lot of potential in a colored herd.
