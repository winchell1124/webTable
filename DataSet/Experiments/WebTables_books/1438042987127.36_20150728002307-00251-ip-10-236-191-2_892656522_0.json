It\u0027s a pity she didn\u0027t have more hits from this record because it definitely deserved a higher profile. Love Take Me To Forever, which I always thought should have been released instead of Martika\u0027s Kichen as a single. Not sure why this album didn\u0027t sell at the time, maybe it was the cover which was possibly to esoteric for Martika\u0027s teen fanbase? The real gem here is Coloured Kisses, which opens so brightly it always reminds me of a Summer\u0027s day. I thought this album would see Martika step up into the next level of stardom, always disappointed the rest of the world didn\u0027t agree. Cool Album!!           by pioneerr89 Now where\u0027re all the music videos ??? \"Martika\u0027s Kitchen\", \"Love thy will be done\" or \"water\" Martika","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0}
