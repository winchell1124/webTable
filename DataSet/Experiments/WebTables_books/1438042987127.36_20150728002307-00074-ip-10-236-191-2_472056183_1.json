If you recall from my last review, I mentioned that I\u0027m not normally one to read contemporary or realistic fiction, and very rarely to I find ones that I really love. Well, let me tell you. I found one. This book was so amazing! There was so much that I loved about it. The characters, the plot, and especially the writing style. I\u0027m going to start with the characters. Out of all the books I\u0027ve read, Anna was probably one of the most well written character I\u0027ve come across. She was very easy to relate to, and the author really got inside her mind in a way that made me stop and think, Hey, I have totally had thoughts like that before. And she just seemed so real when I was reading it. Another great character was St. Clair. I found myself developing a crush on St. Clair. Which truthfully, isn\u0027t very uncommon when I read books. I find book crushes in pretty much every single book I read. But, St. Claire was probably one of my favorite. He was attractive, well I couldn\u0027t see him but he certainly sounded attractive, especially with that accent. His personality is one that is so hard to find in any actual real guys, but it\u0027s the one every one wants to find. He was funny, loved his mom, and wasn\u0027t a stuck up jerk. The plot was also excellently written. I didn\u0027t feel like it was cliche at all. The author did a great job of adding things that many wouldn\u0027t have thought to add, or would have wanted to add. Like St. Clair\u0027s mom getting cancer, that one really threw me for a loop. The plot overall was very believable, and not a plot that \"only happens in books or movies.\" The author\u0027s writing style was also phenomenal. The dialogue, Anna\u0027s thoughts, her reactions to things. Just everything about it was awesome. Stephanie Perkins is probably one of the best authors I have ever read. Now is the time where normally I would talk about the things I didn\u0027t like about the book, but there is literally nothing. I loved everything about it. ...more","review None","review See I can\u0027t get into the whole basketball craze in this book on account of I hate basketball.

Let me start off by saying that I loved this Alright now that it has been several days since I finished I think I\u0027ll right a proper review (sort of). Let me start off by saying that I loved this book. I thought it was just as good as Way of Kings. And I still think it was without a doubt a 5 star book. But that doesn\u0027t mean there weren\u0027t some things I didn\u0027t like. One thing I didn\u0027t like was Branderson\u0027s Moffat tendencies when it came to killing off characters. Meaning he kills them but doesn\u0027t keep them dead. And yes I know there were some deaths, but for the most part they were minor with the exception of Sadeas (whose death I\u0027m not quite sure how I felt about). And it is kind of hard to criticize them because I can see that behind each of these deaths there were reasons, like Szeth\u0027s new Shardblade and I\u0027m assuming whatever Jasnah\u0027s learned will be important also, but I just wish he found other ways to accomplish them. I also found some of Shallan\u0027s viewpoints to make me stop a little and go hmmm to myself. And it was always when she was thinking about her relationship with Adolin. It was like when was reading their interaction it felt like she was actually starting to fall for him. But sometimes when she thought about it she would say that she was trying to manipulate him a little bit (not total manipulation), but I never really saw that in their interactions. And I could be reading into one of those wrong. Hmmm typed out that thought didn\u0027t quite sound like it did in my head but oh well. So overall I still thought it was an amazing book. 5 stars without a doubt. Eagerly waiting the third installment. ...more","review None","review Rating: wavering between 2 and 3 stars My impression of this book was just kind of eh. Everything was just kind of eh.
