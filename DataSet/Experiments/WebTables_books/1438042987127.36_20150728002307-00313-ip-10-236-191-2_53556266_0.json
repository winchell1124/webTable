We used to hang out at The Manhattan in the valley almost every night of the week. They had different themes for different nights �? girls night, boys night, mixed night..and the music was to die for, all cool and funky. From there, we’d walk, yes walk, to Sybil’s, for some more of the same.","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0}
