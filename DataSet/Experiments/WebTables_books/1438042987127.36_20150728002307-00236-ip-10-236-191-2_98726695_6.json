Himes, Chicago ,The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company 1912 JAMES W HIGGINS. The name of no single individual is perhaps more closely associated with the development, upbuilding and improvement of Montavilla than that of James W. Higgins, for he located here when the town contained only one hundred and fifty inhabitants. He has lived to witness the growth of its population to eight thousand and in all the material improvement of the city he has taken active part. He was born in Brunswick, Missouri, November 20, 1857, and is a son of Robert H. and Rebecca A. (Henderson) Higgins, in whose family were six children. Fannie, the eldest, is the wife of George Brannon, of St. Louis. Missouri, the oldest engineer on the Missouri river, having entered the steamboat service a long time prior to the Civil war. He was engineer on the first boat that went up to Fort Benton and he has a very wide acquaintance along the Mississippi and the ports to which his work has taken him. Unto him and his wife have been born four children, Cora, Lee, Joe and Edna. Arbelia Higgins, the second of the family, became the wife of Major J. H. Townson, of Gallatin, Missouri, and they have three children, Walter, Robert and Bessie. John, the next of the family, is living in Arleta, Oregon, and has one child, Mabel. Charles G. is a resident of Guthrie, Oklahoma. James W. is the next of the family. Minnie is the wife of W. E. Osborn, of Gallatin, Missouri, and they have three children, Robert. Margaret and Edwin. The youthful days of James W. Higgins were passed in the manner of most boys of his locality and period and when sixteen years of age he began learning the carpenter\u0027s trade in Missouri, in which state he resided until the spring of 1879. At that date he went to Leadville, Colorado, where he worked for a short time, receiving fifteen dollars per day as his wage for carpentering. He next proceeded to Canon City, Colorado, where he also spent but a brief period, and later was located for a time in Colorado Springs and afterward in Kansas. From the latter point he returned home, continuing in Missouri until the spring of 1880. when he went to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he worked for the government for four years. On the expiration of that period he removed to Harrisonville. Missouri, and while living there was married. He wedded Miss Emma Abbott, a daughter of Silas and Mary J. (Webb) Abbott. Mrs. Higgins is a native of Illinois, but the family had removed to Harrisonville. Missouri, ere her marriage. Three children have been born to them: Blanche, who is engaged in dressmaking and makes her home with her parents; Lee R. S.. who is engaged in the plumbing business in Montavilla and is married and has two children, Elnery and Dorothy; and Roy, who is at home. Following his marriage Mr. Higgins continued to reside in Harrisonville for a year. after which he located in Oberlin. Kansas, where he lived for two years. He then returned to Colorado Springs, where the succeeding four years were passed, after which lie came to Oregon, making his way at once to Portland. He chose Montavilla as the place of his residence, arriving here in 1891. He found a small town of about one hundred and fifty inhabitants. There was a little grocery store owned by a Mr. Johnson, now deceased, a small meat market owned by Murray \u0026 Sloan and a little water plant, which was the property of Warren Burrden. School was held in a\" hall and the only car service was a motor ear running to Mount Tabor every thirty minutes. A year later a car line was built out Glison street to Eighty-fourth. The town has enjoyed substantial and rapid growth, having now a population of eight thousand. There are six handsome churches, a line school, built in an attractive style of architecture, and the improvements of the town include electric lights, cement sidewalks, water works and a thirty-minute car service to Mount Hood and seven-minute service to Portland. After living in Montavilla for a few months Mr. Higgins purchased property and built a home, erecting the first house on Eightieth street. He has continuously engaged in contracting and building, erecting the first house in Hawthorne\u0027s first addition and carrying on his building operations throughout the town. He has been an active participant in the growth and progress of the city and he owns business as well as residence property in Montavilla, which has increased largely in value since he made his first investment. In his political views Mr. Higgins has always been a stalwart democrat and has taken an active interest in politics but not as an office seeker. He has been offered political positions in the city of Portland but would not accept, preferring to concentrate his energies upon his business affairs. He and his family are members of the Methodist Episcopal church and fraternally he is connected with the Woodmen of the World and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. In the latter organization he has filled all of the chairs in the subordinate lodge and he is ever loyal to the teachings of the order and faithful to the high principles for which it stands. His upright and honorable life has gained for him the high respect and good-will of those with whom he has come in contact during the twenty years of his residence in Montavilla. - Webmaster\u0027s Findings - HIGGINS R H 37 M W VA MO CHARITON BRUNSWICK TWP 1860 Name                  Age R H Higgins           37 Rebecca A Higgins 34 Fannie E Higgins    16 Arbelia V Higgins    13 John H Higgins       9 Charles G Higgins   7 William Higgins       2 Robert Sonner       38 Margaret E Sonner 33 Jennie E Sonner      3 James W. is not listed on this census 19 Feb 2008, 61456\u003dSource: History of the Willamette Valley (Oregon), By Herbert O.

Higgins - Baker City Herald - Dr. John Higgins Dr. John R. Higgins, 81, a Baker City native, died March 23, 2002, at his Baker City home. He was lovingly cared for at home by his wife, Esther, following his stroke in November 1996. The rosary will be said today at 7:30 p.m. at St. Francis de Sales Cathedral, corner of First and Church streets. Mass of Christian burial will be Wednesday at 10 a.m. at the cathedral. Father Rob Irwin will officiate. There will be a luncheon following at the cathedral. Burial will be at Mount Hope Cemetery. Dr. John achieved a life of fulfillment devoted to his family, his medical practice and his community. He was born May 6, 1920, in Baker City to Maude Apple Higgins and Thomas J. Higgins. He was the youngest of four children. His brothers, Thomas and Paul, and sister, Katie, preceded him in death. John received his elementary and secondary education at St. Francis Academy. Following his graduation from Oregon State he entered medical school at the University of Oregon School of Medicine in 1939. He received his doctor of medicine degree in 1943 and did his internship at Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland in 1944. There he met his lovely wife, Esther Natterlund, and they were married July 31, 1944. John served his country in the military from 1943-46. In October 1946 he joined his father, Dr. Thomas Higgins, in general practice in Baker City, until his fathers retirement in 1956. Dr. John, or \"Doc\" as he was often called, received his board certification as a charter member in Family Practice in 1972, and continued that certification until his retirement in 1996. He belonged to multiple professional organizations: the American Medical Association, the Academy of Family Practice, and Oregon Physicians Service. He was on medical staff at St. Elizabeth Community Hopsital and served on its board of trustees. The Union Pacific Railroad had him serve as district physician for 44 years. Dr. John was committed to his involvement in his community by his participation in the Elks, Kiwanis, Junior Chamber of Commerce, Knights of Columbus, St. Francis choir, Baker Sheriff?s Posse and as Baker County Medical Examiner. His ability for leadership was recognized often as he held positions in any number of his professional, community and church organizations. He served more than a quarter million patients, and delivered 2,600 babies in the Baker community. Dr. John and his wife, Esther, were married 57 years and were a beautiful example of love and devotion to their family of eight children. He took time to encourage family togetherness. He spent his days off enjoying skiing, hiking, picknicking, fishing and exploring with his family. His famous spaghetti sauce and garlic bread dinners will long be celebrated as a remembrance of him. He nurtured interests in a number of hobbies. His most recent was his love of spinning and weaving. Prior to his stroke he was often seen at the ?swimming hole? (Sam-O Swim Center) doing his laps. He was always striving to learn more and expand his knowledge. He loved his Baker Valley and hearing the train whistles echoing through its expanse. Dr. John is survived by his children: John and Bobbi Higgins, Tim and Paula Higgins, Mary Ellen Fullmer, Patty Lee, Matt and Nancy Higgins, Dr. Milt and Catherine Schild, Frances and Glen Hellings, Tom and Ann Higgins; 24 grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; and numerous nieces and nephews. Surely he is bouncing his grandson, Tyler Higgins, on his knee up in heaven this very day. © Copyright 2001-2008 Western Communications, Inc 1930; Census Place: Baker City, Baker, Oregon; Roll: 1939; Page: 6B; Enumeration District: 3; Image: 23 (No Image Available) Name Age Thomas J Higgins 47 Maud E Higgins 45 Katherine Higgins 22 Thomas Higgins 19 Paul R Higgins 15 John Higgins 9 HIGGINS THOMAS J 38 M W NE OR BAKER 1-WD;BAKER CITY; 1-PCT 1920 Name Age Thomas J Higgins 38 Maude E Higgins 37 Catherine Higgins 11 Thomas Higgins 8 Paul Higgins 4 Tena Berg 59 HEGGINS THOMAS J 28 M W NE OR BAKER 2-WD BAKER 1910 Name Age Thomas J Higgins 28 Maud E Higgins 28 Catherine E Higgins 2 Obituary of Thomas J. Higgins jr.\u0027s wife http://www.bakercityherald.com/news/story.cfm?story_no\u003d1821 Published: February 28, 2003 Eva Dickerson Eva E. Dickerson, 85, of Baker City died Feb. 22, 2003, at St. Elizabeth Health Services after a short illness. Recitation of the rosary will be at 7 p.m. Friday at the Coles Funeral Home, 1950 Place St. Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 11 a.m. Saturday at St. Francis de Sales Cathedral, First and Church streets. The Rev. Robert C. Irwin will celebrate. Interment will be at Mount Hope Cemetery. Visitations will be Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the funeral home. There will be luncheon in the basement of the Cathedral after the service, provided by St. Francis Altar Society. Mrs. Dickerson was born at Hereford on Sept. 30, 1917, to Henry Lance Koontz and Orpha Lucretia Willey Koontz. She was the fourth child of the family, joining a sister, Mary Ferne, and brothers, Clifford and Leslie. Her childhood was spent on the family farm at Hereford, which had been homesteaded by her grandfather, Orlando Chester Koontz in the late 1800s. Both brothers were taken by illness at the age of 18, leaving her and sisters, Ferne and Colleen (born in 1925) as the \"ranch hands.\" They worked side by side with their parents, Lance and Orpha, to keep the ranch going. After a brief move to Cascade, Idaho, during the Depression, where Lance and the boys worked in the Eccles Lumber Mill and Orpha baked pies for a local boarding house, the family returned to the ranch in 1930. Eva attended her junior year of high school at Grant High School in Portland, then returned to graduate with her longtime class friends from Hereford Union High School in 1935. In November of that year, she married Thomas J. Higgins Jr., son of Baker City doctor, Thomas Sr., and wife, Maud. They had four children: Nancy (1937), Mary Jo (1940), Mike (1941) and Richard (1944). Tragedy again touched Eva\u0027s life in June 1944, when Tommy was struck and killed by lightning while irrigating their farm ground. Left with four children between the ages of 6 and three months, a high school education, and no formal job training, Eva, through her family support group and a lot of determination, moved her small family to Baker City. In 1946, she met and married James Dickerson. She and Jimmy had four children: Kay (1947), Don (1950), Pat (1952) and Percy (1960). In addition to this family of eight, Eva and Jimmy helped raise Jimmy\u0027s two children, Judy (1940) and Bill (1943). Hereford was the magnet that kept drawing Eva back in those days, to live and to raise her children. After short stays in Baker City, Caldwell, Idaho, and John Day, the family moved back to Hereford in 1949. After the partial shutdown of Ellingson Lumber Co. at Unity in 1959, Eva and Jimmy and the five children who were still at home relocated to Baker City, where Jimmy continued his employment with Ellingson\u0027s until retiring in 1976. He and Eva worked to develop their newly started Amway business. They met new friends, traveled (especially on an airplane, for Eva!) and they thrived on this experience. After Jimmy\u0027s sudden death in October 1983, Eva continued her involvement with her Amway group and her bowling group, while residing in the home she and Jimmy bought in 1978. With the responsibility of caring for that home becoming more of a burden, Eva decided to move to an apartment, now owned by a niece, Mary Lou, and husband, Alex Sackos, in 1997. With the loving care and assistance of her sister, Colleen, she was able to live in her apartment until her death. Eva will be remembered by her family and friends as a positive, up-beat person who, in spite of life\u0027s challenges and stresses, continued to look for the good in each person and each situation. Through her determination and persistence, she provided opportunities for her children to grow up in a close-to-ideal situation, first in Hereford, then in Baker City. She had the knack of knowing when to be a firm guide and when to back away and give her kids room to grow and learn from their own experience, which resulted in a family of children and grandchildren with the self-confidence to choose their own paths. Her love of the outdoors was passed on to her children, in the form of an appreciation for and respect of nature, a legacy she was extremely pleased and proud to pass down to her offspring. She was preceded in death by her parents; her brothers, Clifford and Leslie; sister, Ferne Anderson; husbands, Tommy Higgins and Jimmy Dickerson; and her grandsons Jeremiah Dickerson, Donny and Mark Curtiss. Survivors include her sister, Colleen Jones of Baker City; children, Nancy and her husband, Alan Endicott, of Pendleton, Mary Jo Higgins and her husband, Bob Kowing, of John Day, Mike Higgins and his wife, Donna, of Halfway, Dick Higgins of Baker City, Kay and her husband, Vernon Nakada, of Ontario, Don Dickerson and his wife, Dorothy, of 100 Mile House, British Columbia, Pat Dickerson and his wife, Jill, of Jacksonville, and Percy Dickerson and his partner, Leslie Maiwald, of Baker City; stepchildren Judy and her husband, Bill Blevins, of La Grande, and Bill Dickerson and his wife, Tami, of Boise; sister-in-law, Mary Ann Slocum of Portland; an aunt, Erma Cole of Hillsboro; 30 grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren, and numerous nieces, nephews and cousins. In lieu of flowers, Eva could best be honored by planting a tree or a rose bush in her memory, by taking a walk in the buttercup-covered hills, by putting up a bird feeder, or by thinking good thoughts of her on your next picnic. Buttercups were one of her favorite wildflowers as they emerged from the snow-covered, sagebrush hills around Hereford in the spring. © Copyright 2001-2008}","textBeforeTable":"09 Jul  2009 Source: History of the Willamette Valley (Oregon), By Herbert O.
