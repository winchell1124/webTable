The introduction featured the following text: \"This Mission May Be Over But Let\u0027s Get The Party Started! Paramount Network Television invites you and your guest to journey back in time at the historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and glimpse the future in the newly-launched Theodore Restaurant and Lounge. Let\u0027s commemorate the final voyage of Star Trek: Enterprise\"., 9632\u003dStar Trek: Enterprise (originally titled Enterprise until Season 3) is the fifth live-action TV series set in the Star Trek universe and the sixth in total. Created by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, and based upon Gene Roddenberry\u0027s classic 1966 Star Trek (and its subsequent spin-offs), Enterprise was a \"prequel\", set a century before the time of Kirk and Spock. The series followed the voyages of the first starship Enterprise and mankind\u0027s first steps into the \"final frontier\". Initially titled as simply Enterprise, the series ran an abbreviated four seasons. The series debuted in 2001 on the United Paramount Network. It was cancelled in 2005., 11161\u003dAs of 2015, due to its status as a prequel series, Enterprise is the only Star Trek production whose continuity is not affected by the events of the 2009 film reintroducing the crew of James T. Kirk., 17283\u003dLike its predecessor, Star Trek: Voyager, Enterprise aired on UPN, rather than in first-run syndication like TNG and DS9. Premiering on 26 September 2001 with a strong opening, the two-hour pilot \"Broken Bow\" garnered a 9.9 overnight rating and a 15% share. Ratings, however, declined over the next few seasons, dipping to an average 2.5 million viewers an episode., 78484\u003dWith four seasons, Enterprise reached syndication less than a year after its cancellation, in some markets airing multiple times a week. However, with the 40th anniversary of Star Trek, Enterprise was replaced in syndication by \"remastered\" versions of classic TOS episodes on 16 September 2006., 20642\u003dLaunched in the year 2151, the NX-class starship Enterprise, (the first of United Earth\u0027s advanced warp five vessels) was at first on temporary assignment. Though years of preparation still lay ahead, the ship was unexpectedly put into service when a Klingon national crash-landed on Earth, putting the entire planet at stake should he not make it back to his people. Under the command of United Starfleet Captain Jonathan Archer, son of the famed scientist Henry Archer, the crew of Enterprise succeeded in their mission, but found themselves surrounded by deeper mysteries. Warranting the extension of their assignment into a full-blown mission of deep space exploration, the crew of the Enterprise set off into the unknown, taking with them a Vulcan science officer (or chaperone) named T\u0027Pol and a Denobulan doctor named Phlox., 19760\u003dEnterprise was nominated for five individual Saturn Awards, won an ASCAP Award in 2002 for \"Top TV Series\", was nominated for seventeen Emmy Awards, winning four, and two episodes were nominated for Hugo Awards.}","lastModified":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 09:37:06 GMT","textBeforeTable":"ENT Season 1, 25 episodes: Season 1Edit Episode listEdit Gene Roddenberry - Creator of Star Trek Dawn Velazquez - Producer Alan Kobayashi - Graphic Designer Andr√© Bormanis - Executive Story Editor, Science Consultant, Writer Alan Brennert - Producer, Writer Mike Sussman - Producer, Writer Ken LaZebnik - Supervising Producer, Writer David A.
