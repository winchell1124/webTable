Another muder mystery begins when a snuff video is found on a cell phone, setting in motion a whole series of puzzling events. I continue to enjoy this character and the stories. Fun, mindless entertainment.","J.K. Rowlings first novel aimed at adults is pretty good but not great. The death of a local politician causes a “casual vacancy�? which requires a special election to fill. Various people in the small town have ambitions of filling the seat. The book looks into the lives of several local families. It’s a bit of a soap opera, but the characters are interesting and the story reasonable. A bit longer than it should have been but I enjoyed it, though I much preferred The Cuckoo’s Calling which she wrote under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.","Arizona Sheriff Joanna Brady and Seattle Detective JP Beaumont team up in this murder mystery. Investigating separate cases, there turns out to be a link which brings the two together. As a reader of both series, I enjoyed this one.","I accidentally bought the abridged version of this book from Audible so wasn’t sure how that would work out. Turns out is was just fine. It’s a fun mystery �? a professor meets a woman and they fall madly in love, but then she inexplicably dumps him to marry an old flame. Six years later the old flame is murdered and it turns out he was married �? to someone else. The story unfolds and makes for easy entertainment. Hard to imagine what was cut from the originial �? I enjoyed this version.","When a wealthy man dying of cancer leaves his estate to his black housekeeper, the family takes the matter to court. Local lawyer Jake Brigance receives a letter from the man written before he died asking him to defend his wishes. It’s a typical Grisham legal thriller with lots of side stories. Fun and easy read.","The latest in the Harry Bosch series, this involves an old case from 1992 when the young Harry was the first on the scene to the murder of a white woman during the race riots in LA. With many other crimes occurring, the case was left to linger but is now resurrected. Harry has his typical run-ins with incomeptent beaurocrats but manages to find the “Black Box�? �? the crucial clue that leads to solving the case. A good story and easy read","(Bradley) This book will appeal to the animal lovers among us. Ray put together a series of short stories from Hope for Wildlife, a Nova Scotia wildlife rehabilitation center, with experiences over the past 16 years of its existence. Hope was founded and continues to be run by Hope Swinimer, a certified veterinary practice manager, who also works a full time job at as administrator of the Dartmouth Veterinary Hospital. Ray has included magnificent color photographs and some very interesting background on the each rescue animal whose story he tells. I most warn you, not all the stories have perfect endings, but he does provide some insight into the challenges of rescuing wild animals, rehabilitating them and releasing back into the wild. The only aspect of this story I felt Ray missed was some serious discussion regarding the underling ethical questions and economic challenges associated with these types of organizations.","(Bradley) This is a fascinating story of one of the most audacious heists in history. In 2003 an extremely gifted, overly confident Student Intern at the NASA Space Center Houston, pulled off an amazing theft of moon rocks from NASA. This is the true story of how Thad Roberts went from high potential NASA Employee, maybe even Astronaut, to the Federal Penitentiary. Ben does a very good job of keeping the suspense up, even though you know the outcome from the beginning of the book. This was written with deep cooperation of Thad Roberts and is a very interesting read. This is a classic example how to much confidence can sink the ship. Very quick and easy read.","(Bradley) This is a wonderful story about hope and what can actually be done in Africa to help the continent develop. Very much worth ones time to read and appreciate all the good will of those who are trying to give back some of their business success in a positive fashion","If this story wasn’t true, it would be hard to believe. In 1897, a series of grisly discoveries of dismembered human remains begins the unraveling of a murder mystery. At the same time, newspaperment William Randolph Hurst and Joseph Pulitzer are battling for supremacy in their field. This is perhaps the first time the press figured prominently in not only reporting, but in interfering with and spinning the events. It’s a well told story, well documented and very interesting.","Beautifully written historical fiction novel covering the story of several people in Armenia during the genocide in 1915 and the granddaughter of two of those people who knew little of the events of that time until she began researching her family history. Somewhat autobiographical, this is an engaging story set in a very real and brutal time. Well worth a read.","A reclusive and cynical resident of a small town is thrust into an investigation when his neighbor dies and he assumes responsibility for administering her estate. Good characters and well told story. An enjoyable read.","(Bradley) As a sailor and adventurer, I enjoyed Dave \u0026 Jaja’s exploits. It is a well written and fun book to read, especially for anyone interested in northern latitude sailing. It also provides those who do not seek adventure offshore, an accurate look at some of the challenges faced. Yes, their boat may have been a little on the small side and less complex to operate than the average ocean cruising boat, but we have met people who crossed both the Atlantic and Pacific on even a smaller boat with a 3 to 6 year old. I can also say, that while some people might unfairly be critical because they did all of this with 3 children, I have yet to meet any boat children who are not light years ahead of their peers in intelligence, maturity and personality, while still being children appropriate to their age. My only criticism is that in this day and age, there were not a few more pictures or at least a valid link to current website. This book is worth your time to read if you enjoy real life adventure.","Set in Italy, a detective is assigned to investigate the death of a transvestite. Refusing to believe the obvious conclusions, he becomes obsessed with finding the truth. A nice change from the standard US murder mystery as this introduces a different culture but with some great characters.","The authors story of growing up with a severely autistic brother. It is a heart wrenching personal tale of the toll that this special needs child brings on the whole family and especially the impact it has on the author, who at once loves his brother but also longs to have a brother who he interact and share his life with. The book takes an unexpected twist which will have you on a bit of a roller coaster. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn more about autism or about the realities of caring for a severely disabled child.","A well researched and detailed account of Henrietta Lacks, a poor black woman whose cervical cancer cells were the first human cells to be successfully grown in a laboratory and subsequently revolutionized medical research. It is also a sad story of Henrietta’s family, who were never told the truth about the cells and the lack or privacy and regulation over patients rights during that time. The book is a bit tedious at times, but overall a very well done story.","From the author of the Kite Runner, this is another wonderful novel set in Afghanistan. This one centers around love, family, and difficult choices. Though there is little violence or mention of war, the novel is gripping and moves along at a good pace. Beginning with a bit of folklore about a man forced to give up one of his children to an ogre, the story continues with a poor family forced to make difficult decisions.","A waitress finds herself unemployed and is convinced to take a job caring for a young quadriplegic man injured in an accident. Initially not liking one another, they evolve to a deep friendship and help each other to grow and change in many ways. A book about humanity and personal growth it also focuses on the rights of individuals to make their own choices about how and when to exit with dignity. A very good book.","A down and out private investigator is engaged to look into a supposed suicide. His assistant ,by way of a temp agency, turns out to have a knack for the business. An interesting and entertaining book, though a bit long in parts. This was clearly meant to test the waters for a new series �? I would read more if there is are sequels.","Another in the Lincoln Lawyer series, Mickey Haller is again defending a client accused of murder. The victim is also a former client and Haller works to untangle a web o f past and present deceit. He races against time to convince the jury �? the Gods of Guilt �? that his client is innocent.","A wide ranging novel, this story focuses on an average Japanese man whose wife leaves him. In the process of searching for her and evaluating his life, he meets a variety of interesting characters, including a mysterious teenage girl, veterans of WWI who provide great and sometimes gory details of events of the war, and a pair of pseudo-supernatural sisters who have unusual powers. An international best-seller, this is a pleasant change from the average English language novel. Though I would have preferred it to be a bit shorter and to have a more neatly packaged ending/conclusion, I found it very entertaining and enjoyable.","The author, a psychiatrist, theorizes that sane or mentally healthy individuals do not function as leaders in times of crisis as well as individuals with a history of depression or bipolar disorder. He uses a number of examples, including Lincoln, Sherman, JFK, FDR, Churchill and others. His premise is that these men, who all suffered some form of mental illness, developed certain traits such as empathy and resilience, which enhanced their ability to provide leadership during times of crisis. While it is a fascinating book and the author makes a good case, I’m not sure I completely buy into the conclusions. There are likely hundreds of other examples","I’ve long been a fan of the Alex Delaware series and found that I had missed a few of them over the years so I’ve been filling in the holes. This story centers around the discovery of an infant buried in back yard many years ago, followed by some new murders that send Alex and Milo off on a typical investigation/adventure. A solid effort in this series","In this one, Alex and girlfriend Robin visit a favorite hotel that is about to close. There they notice a beautiful young woman, apparently waiting for someone who never arrives. Later the girl turns up dead and Delaware investigates the case with friend Detective Milo Sturgis. A typical Alex Delaware novel, good for this type of book.","A rare murder in a small Canadian town brings in Inspecter Gamache, a Quebec detective, and his team to unravel the truth. A good story line, great characters, and artful description of this small town make it a very enjoyable read. Looking forward to others in this series.","(Bradley) This is highly unusual for me, as I have not read a straight fiction book in years. Silva does a good job of keeping one on the edge of their seat, while not making the story too implausible. It is a quick and easy read that does have some suspenful twists. The real question here is just how much of this book is really fiction. Enjoy.","Second in the Starbuck series on the Civil War, this book begins with a story of Oliver Wendell Holmes, the future Supreme Court justice, and his wounding at the battle of Ball’s Bluff. Holmes was a first cousin of my grandmother and I grew up hearing stories about him, including his participation in the war, so I knew this to be an accurate historical description. Again, the primary fictional characters are interesting, and serve to provide a framework for the artfully described events and battles. Though I’m a little weary of war books for now, I will resume this series at a future date.","First book in the Starbuck historical fiction series about the US Civil War. The main character, Nathaniel Starbuck, comes from a Boston family but ends up in Virginia where he fights for the Confederate states. The characters are a good backdrop for realistic and accurate descriptions of battles, events, and historical figures. This book culminates with the first major battle of the war Manassas/Bull Run. Recommended for anyone interested in US History and the Civil War.","The book’s author is a cold-water, long distance swimmer who has a keen interest in polar regions. This book combines the story of Amundsen’s explorations to the North and South poles with author Cox’s quest to swim in the coldest waters of the world as she retraces some of Amundsen’s routes. The subtitle is a bit misleading as the book is at least half about the authors exploits rather than Amundsen’s. It is also a book written by a great swimmer, so not necessary a literary masterpiece. With those caveats, however, I found it a very interesting book, especially her first hand accounts of swimming in below freezing water. Really makes me feel like a wimp!","The author suffers from a condition know as face-blindness (prosopagnosia), which makes it impossible for her to recognize people based on their facial features. The book eventually gets around to this subject, and offers some personal and scientific insight on this rare condition. I was curious about this subject as I read Crashing Through many years ago where a blind man’s vision was restored, yet he was also unable to distinguish people based on facial features. This book does discuss how otherwise normal people can suffer from this phenonmemon. However, the author spends a lot of time talking about her dysfunctional family and possibly schizophrenic mother �? somewhat like Running with Scissors but not as good. Though that part was of some interest, I found myself wanting her to get around to the face blindess and would have preferred more time spent on that and less on her childhood.","The true story of a Catch Me If You Can caliber con man �? a German born man who moves to the US and assumes a variety of identities which nobody ever questions. His last is that of Clark Rockefeller and everyone who knows him, including his wife, believes he is a member of the wealthy family. The author seemed to develop an obsession with the story, but does a good job of piecing together the sequences of events. Interesting read, though there’s a bit of “so what�? to it.","Good Grisham thriller. A small town lawyer is unfairly convicted of money landering on behalf of his client and sent to a minimum security prison. When a federal judge is murdered, he trades knowledge of his crime for his release, resulting in an interesting series of events that take many twists and turns and should leave you satisfied at the end.","A fictionalized account of three women who are held in the Atlit camp in the Middle East following the end of WWII. Atlit, located near Haifa, was a British facility and many Jews who fled after the world were “displaced persons�? with nowhere to go. Many of them ended up going from concentration camps during the war to holding facilities after the war. Although the characters are not real, the backdrop is, including the finale where the “inmates�? are rescued and sent to various kibbutzes. I confess to having very little knowledge of the events in this book beforehand and found it quite educational and well-written. Highly recommended.","(Bradley’s review) Written by the ex-publisher of the Chicago Tribune, Squires brings wit, honesty, and insight to the horse racing industry. After leaving publishing he and his wife “the dominate one�? decide to pursue their passion for horse breeding, after a land investment turns sour, by starting a breeding farm. Of course, the goal is breed a winner of the world’s most important race �? the Kentucky Derby. In spite of the fact that very early in the book you know the outcome, this is a very revealing look at horseracing, with all its blemishes and accomplishments. Other than providing a little too much detail about which horses are related, kind of like trying to follow your brothers�? second cousin on his mother’s side once removed, it is a very quick and worthwhile read.","True story of a group of British climbers in 2006 who witnessed the murder by Chinese troops of a 17 year old Tibetan nun. The author researched the story of the nun as well as the climbers to provide a factual account of real events that will leave you saddened and angry. Anyone who thinks the Chinese think and act like we do should read this book.","The latest in the Harry Bosch detective series, this is again an entertaining and easy read. Bosch is working on cold cases and gets a hit on some DNA from an old case. Soon he gets another case �? an apparent suicide of the son of his nemesis. Or is it suicide? Good story, credible plot, Connelly is always a sure thing for a quick, easy, entertaining read.","Former US Marshall Tim Rackley is called back into action to rescue a girl who has joined a mind-control cult. Well crafted story, fast moving and fun. Good entertaining read. This is part of a series featuring the hero and I will probably read more of them","A novel centered around the mysterious diary of a supposed Union spy who was among the crew of the Hunley, the first submarine credited with sinking a ship during the Civil War. Nice writing with a story that weaves some history into a reasonable plot.","The author, a literary editor for the Paris Review, is married to a Korean-American and they decide to buy a deli in New York for his mother-in-law. An entertaining memoir, it weaves the story of the deli with that of George Plimpton, editor of the Paris Review, life in the big city, and being part of a Korean family. Easy read �? entertaining and fun","(By Bradley)Very interesting topic (sharks), but the story was a little too slow in parts. It was almost a cross between a research document and a good story. Yes, the book has a several agendas, but you do not have to agree with them to enjoy learning about Sharks. As a diver, spear fisherman (no not sharks) and a cruiser I found much of the story very interesting, but with a little to much detail. A good read for those interested in why world needs to start thinking with it brain over emotions, if we want to save the sea.","I love Colleen McCullough and was looking for a change from the murder mystery genre which I’ve read far too many of. Looking forward to a typical Colleen McCullough historical fiction novel, I soon learned it was �? A Murder Mystery!! But still enjoyable and well written. Enjoyable but a real departure from what I expected!","People who live on boats typically try to avoid big waves. This book is about people who seek them out. The author follows some of the most extreme surfers in the world who engage in a practice called tow-surfing �? riding waves so big the only way to catch them is to be towed to them via jet-ski and launched at 40mph. The author also provides some scientific insight into waves and weaves in other stories about shipwrecks, tsunamis, and other results of large waves. A book I couldn’t put down!","I have enjoyed Connelley’s Harry Bosch and Lincoln Laywer series. This is a series featuring a crime reporter, Jack McEvoy, who looks into his cop brother’s suicide, only to discover a pattern of cop suicides that leads to an intriguing discovery. As in other series, a good plot with great characters. I’ll read more of this series.","In 1933, nobody wanted the job of ambassador to Germany so Roosevelt tapped William Dodd, a professor from Chicago. Dodd and his family, including his young adult daughter, moved to Germany where they experienced first-hand the rise of Hitler and the troubling changes taking place. Dodd’s daughter had an active social life, placing her at the center of many interesting situations. Dodd was concerned about things happening in Germany but lacked credibility with his superiors and those in Washington. A well-written and intriguing book by the author of Devil in the White City and Thunderstruck. Well worth a read!","In 1875, a Cheyenne Chief asked President Grant for 1000 white women to marry their warriors. In their culture, tribal associations are passed through the women, so this would result in a generation of children who would pave the way for assimilation into the white man’s culture. Though that request was never actually granted, this book presumes that it did and is the fictional account of one of the brides, May Dodd, who is released from an insane asylum for her promise to marry and bear a child. Very well written, the book provides an excellent sense of the difference between the cultures and life in the wild west. Parts of it are a bit of a stretch, but it is engaging and gripping throughout.","This book inter-weaves a fictional story of a murder in a polygamyst cult with the story of Ann Eliza Young, Brigham Young’s 19th wife who divorced the prophet and became an outspoken opponent of polygamy. There certainly is real history of the Mormon church, including the advent and later abolishment of polygamy. What I liked about this book is that it compelled me to do additional research on my own �? the book is a work of fiction but has a lot of real history and it was intriguing to try to separate which was which.","This book inter-weaves a fictional story of a murder in a polygamyst cult with the story of Ann Eliza Young, Brigham Young’s 19th wife who divorced the prophet and became an outspoken opponent of polygamy.

Though the basis of the accusation seems thin from the start, it leads to an entertaining trial with plenty of intrigue. A good ending with a couple of surprises too!","(Bradley) Robin Olds is a West Point Graduate, accelerated class of 43, who goes on to become an ace in both World War II and the Vietnam war. He offers some very interesting and accurate insights into the challenges we face with our Militrary. Many of his comments could be applied to the problems we have faced in recent wars. More importantly his story offers insights into the challanges faced by those who grew up in a militrary family in the 50’s \u0026 60’s. I highly recomend Fighter Pilot and would have given it 4 stars except for some excessive detail on actual dogfights, which does not translate well into visual images for non-pilots.","Well written story of brothers in Ethiopia who follow their biological father and adoptive parents into medicine. The author is a doctor and brings a great deal of insight into that area. The book is quite interesting and gripping and gives some glimpses into Ethiopia including events leading to the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selasse. While I wasn’t wild about the story surrounding the mysterious biological father, there were many aspects of the book that I did enjoy.","I greatly enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy and “saved�? this one for over a year, knowing it was the last. That was a mistake as this book is more of a continuation of the second one than a story unto itself. As I had forgotten many of the details of book 2, it took quite a while to get back into it. I also found the story not nearly as compelling as in the first two book. Nevertheless, it was still a cut above many of the fictional novels out there.","Another epic from Ken Follett, this one takes place in the years before during and after WWI and the Russian Revolution. Characters include British Lords and working class, Americans, Germans, and Russians, whose lives intertwine throughout. Filled with real historic events, the book provides a great understanding of these momentous events.
