I did not understa After I read the first paragraph of The Sound and the Fury, I had to stop and laugh and say to myself- What in the heck is going on? I did not understand a bit of what I read. But, I plugged on. By the end of the first chapter I sat in total amazement. The style- his prose, matched that of a kindergartner. I had no idea where Faulkner was leading me. Section two of the novel furthered the story only slightly for me, and was only slightly less confusing, but it does have wonderful turns of phrases and imagery. And it is here I began to see Faulkner\u0027s ability as a wordsmith. By the third and fourth sections of the story it all began to gel. You see, the novel is told from the perspective of brothers (the first brother having the mental ability of a child), but really the novel is about the women. Their mother, their sister Caddy, and Caddy\u0027s illegitimate daughter Quentin (named after Caddy\u0027s brother- the second section perspective). To \"modern\" eyes, TS\u0026TF is totally racist. Faulkner, known as the quintessential southern author, lays out the racism of the American south unabashedly. Although I winced every time I saw it, so naked and unashamed, I had a feeling he would redeem himself. And he did. The last section is unofficially \"Dilsey\u0027s Section\". Dilsey being the black woman house servant for the family and it it ended with her being the only \"sane\" voice in the novel. This book is why I love reading the classics. When done right, they will challenge you and yes even frustrate you, but the satisfaction when you reach the \"AHA!\" moment is all the more rewarding for it, imo. Southern Gothic literature that crosses swords with reader at every turn, this one gets a 5 out of 5 from me. ...more","review Somehow I missed getting my thoughts on this one up here thus far- so here goes: With something as anticipated as the 7th (and final!) book in The Harr Somehow I missed getting my thoughts on this one up here thus far- so here goes: With something as anticipated as the 7th (and final!) book in The Harry Potter series, there is massive potential for alot of people to be disappointed (much like I was with the Order of the Phoenix movie)- I was sure I was going to be disappointed- because really, who can live up to that kind of hype? But to my IMMENSE joy- Rowling delivered for me. (Great Googlely Mooglely did she ever!) I cannot think of a single thing that she did wrong in this book. Rather than disappoint, gives her fans what they wanted- no needed from the story, and she gives a big fat smooch with a sweet little epilogue that ties it all up in a nice little bow! Okay first a little non-spoilerage: Starting where The Half Blood Prince left off, The Deathly Hallows takes the three pals (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) into certain peril almost immediately and doesn\u0027t let up until the end. They are on a mission. With a message seemingly from the grave, Dumbledore has tasked them to seek and destroy the 7 horcruxes- the enchanted items the evil Lord Voldemort has created to maintain invulnerability. Dumbledore has tasked the three, and the three alone, to do this and to keep it a secret. Although their families and friends, including The Order of the Phoenix, know nothing of the secret mission- other than knowing there is something that Dumbledore asked them to do-, they are in danger as well because old Voldy will use whatever he can to destroy Harry, the boy he believes may eventually end his life because of a prophesy given years ago by Professor Trelawny. But. Much to Harry, Ron and Hermione\u0027s advantage, Voldy doesn\u0027t know that they know about the horcruxes. So we got that? Harry must destroy the horcruxes and then face the dark lord in a final battle that will end one of their lives- or more likely, both. ON TO THE SPOILERAGE (Don\u0027t read if you are one of the few people left on the planet to have not read the series!!) HOLEEE CRICKEY! So many things. The opening scene at Malfoy Manor I could see being played out excellently in a movie-. The death eaters gathered listening to The Dark Lord while a bound body slowly turns over the table. Particularly eery for me because we find Snape giving up the timing in which Harry will move from the Dursley\u0027s to a safe house. (I still was not set on the fact that Snape was evil when I opened the book. This did much to sway me in the other direction.) Next we find Harry saying his final goodbye to the Dursley\u0027s with Dudders being surprisingly gracious. I thought for sure Petunia might give over more but alas- a bitter woman all the way. The Order arrives to escort Harry out with a little trickery but they are, of course, attacked from the get go. Hedgewig dying in the first 50 pages?! Actually felt sad over that one! Even more so then over Mad Eye\u0027s death. (Yep he\u0027s out too.) They arrive at the safe house safe and, for some of them, not completely sound. It is then The Three set about getting ready for the mission- keeping it a secret from the Order as Dumbledore wished. After Bill and Fleur marry, they leave, and a big chunk of the book covers they\u0027re hopping around working out the puzzle of the horcurxes- and something new. The deathly hallows. Three items that will also make a wizard immortal. Because Harry is connected to Voldemort once again, (actually he never was disconnected as we find at the end), he realizes that the Dark Lord is after the Deathly Hallows. But thru some brutal circumstances that happened after he sidetracked to catch Voldy going after the Hallows, Harry finally decides he must not be dissuaded from his original quest. Which leads him to the final confrontation- at Hogwarts, naturally. (I LOVED that she brought them home in the end!) During the quest there\u0027s some tension between the three and one of them bails for a time. But to my joy that doesn\u0027t last too long. (Very well done as well because I was sure Rowling was splitting them up so that Harry has to do the deed all alone.) For the romance lover in me, Ron and Hermione come very close together during this time and come together for an eventual snog that so fit Hermione\u0027s character I almost cried- and definitely laughed out loud with a satisfying \"AWWWW!\" Ron is so gallant at times I want to kiss him too! Harry is so focused on his mission we don\u0027t see much \u0027shipping on his end, but- he\u0027s always very conscious of wanting to keep his lady love safe- also very well played by Rowling! Snape/Dumbledore. What can I say. She had me guessing on Snape until something suddenly came into focus that had been lingering around in my noggin but had yet to solidify. (And I can\u0027t tell you when, but it was before Harry got to see Snape\u0027s thoughts.) Of course Dumbledore gave up his life to Snape. What better way to protect Harry then to have a spy right next to the enemy, which is where Snape would be placed by killing off one the most powerful wizards- and one so hated by Voldemort. But when Rowling pulles it all together- with Harry seeing Snape\u0027s deep love for Lily, I again felt awed at Rowling\u0027s skill. (Puzzle pieces falling into place make me very satisfied. No, I\u0027m not saying she\u0027s gonna go down in history for technical merit, but jeeze louise can she plot!) Then- harry dies. But I knew Harry wasn\u0027t really gonna stay dead. At least not after he finally cracked open the snitch that Dumbledore had left Harry in his will. The third Deathly Hallow- the resurrection stone. But then, when it all came down, I don\u0027t think it was the resurrection stone that actually brought him back. It just brought back all his loved ones that had died up until that point- for a time at least. (I\u0027m gonna have to do a reread to fully digest all that.) We do know that part of Harry which actually died, the part that had to die, was the part of Voldemort that lived in Harry after he attacked him as a baby. (You see, Harry was in fact the 7th horcrux that needed to be destroyed before Voldemort could become mortal again.) Either way, after the revelation of the resurrection stone, I knew Harry wouldn\u0027t be dead for long. And, thank Rowling, he wasn\u0027t. (And nope she didn\u0027t kill off Ron nor Hermione! NOR Hargrid for that matter, and that was the one false spoiler I saw before I read the book- that Snape kills Hagrid!! NOT TRUE! NOT TRUE! NOT TRUE!!! BUT someone does die that no fan wanted to see go. The problem was it happened in the heat of battle and there was so much going on that one didn\u0027t really have the time to fully grieve the death. That perhaps disappointed me a little.) In the end, Harry is victorious... and we of course wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. YEA FOR HARRY! YEA FOR US!! YEA FOR ROWLING!! Perfect and sly of her wasn\u0027t it? Before it\u0027s release she had been telling us he\u0027s gonna die- And he did! But we also get our Happily Ever After! I loved, loved, loved the 7th and final installment so naturally- 5 out of 5 from me!!! ...more","review Salinger\u0027s literary style was for me the most intriguing part of the book ... that and the ending. The oft banned and oft assigned to the high school s Salinger\u0027s literary style was for me the most intriguing part of the book ... that and the ending. The oft banned and oft assigned to the high school student Catcher in the Rye is a coming-of-age novel centered around Holden Caulfield, a seventeen year old prep school adolescent who shares his lonely, life-changing twenty-four hour stay in New York City. He experiences and exposits upon the \"phoniness\" of the adult world around him while attempting to deal with the death of his younger brother, a seeming need to lie, and troubling sexual experiences- almost to the point of tediousness. The book was certainly ahead of it\u0027s time. Published in the early 50\u0027s, The Catcher in the Rye\u0027s language could not have been seen often in much of what was being published for public consumption at the time. Yet, I believe it will stand as a record of the language of the youth of America, and perhaps even how they thought, in the 50\u0027s and 60\u0027s. In more recent times another sort of controversy attached itself to the book... From a review of Salinger\u0027s novel by Brian Banks: John Lennon\u0027s assassin, Mark Chapman, asked the former Beatle to sign a copy of the book earlier in the morning of the day that he murdered Lennon. Police found the book in his possession upon apprehending the psychologically disturbed Chapman. However, the book itself contains nothing that could be attributed with leading Chapman to act as he did - it could have been any book that he was reading the day he decided to kill John Lennon - and as a result of the fact that it was The Catcher in the Rye, a book describing a nervous breakdown, media speculated widely about the possible connection. This gave the book even more notoriety. A conspiracy theorist wet dream- the aforementioned theory has yet to die. Many reviewers say that Salinger\u0027s style and themes were intentional. I wonder. Did he sit down and write with expressed purpose or did he just fly by the seat of his pants and write what was in him to write? Either way, it deserves it\u0027s status as a part of the greats in American lit- if for a record of a cultural shift alone. ...more","review Slow paced and tedious I wanted to give up on Lady Chatterly\u0027s Lover so many times.

But I\u0027m stubborn so I couldn\u0027t let myself give up on it. Whereas I\u0027m sure this book was a shocker in the late 20\u0027s when it was published, to my modern eyes, it was no biggie. Yes it was graphic, but in no way could one consider this pornographic! The first section bored me to tears, full of mind-numbing conversations that had no significance other than for the author to show how intellectual he was. I could barely read a page without my eyes drooping closed. Yes, I got that their conversations had a point- \"The dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialization.\" Yeah, I got it. But to stretch it out for the length of the entire book? Ugh. When Lady Chatterley met Mellors, her soon to be lover- things got more interesting- for about 10 pages. Then back to the tedium. I truly liked her lover Mellors. A vetern of the war and of the lower class, he seemed the most intelligent of the characters. Which was, of course, the most shocking part of the story back in the day- the fact that a member of the upper class, Lady Chatterley, cheated on her upper crust husband with a servant. Connie (Lady Chatterley) I found wishy-washy, whiney, and downright annoying. NOT a heroine to love. BUT she knew how to find her pleasure and wasn\u0027t ashamed of it. (Plus for her!) Clifford, her husband- Lord Chatterley to her Lady- I actually felt pity for, though the author did his best to make him seem unworthy of Connie. Here\u0027s a short look at Lord and Lady Chatterley: Cliff, wounded and crippled during the war, was unable to perform his husbandly duties. Connie grew to loathe him and headed out for greener pastures. Now, I\u0027ll give that Cliff was a snob and a control freak, but pitiful to be sure, and in the end didn\u0027t deserve Connie\u0027s selfishness. In the end I found this book to be overrated and overly praised... however, I am glad I read LCL.

Apparently Huxley in this dystopian piece on what the society he lived in might look like at it’s full out extents realized this way before we did. (Darn you Aldous!) Written in the 30’s it’s almost eery how close the world he created in Brave New World is to our own. (Eery and frightening because his work was meant to be satirical!) Eugenics, Media/Technology controlling society, State Propaganda, Consumerism, Industry made Gods, Corporate Corruption, even cheap throw away clothes ala Walmart- its all in there and it scares the bejesus out of me because this scary world is us! The story is told mainly around Lenina, Bernard Marx (names look familiar? They should), \u0026 John Savage. Lenina is a child of the state- altho slightly odd in that she prefers monogamy instead of \"everyone for everyone\". But not as odd as Bernard who is as smart as an Alpha (the top caste) but looks like an Epsilon (lower caste). He sees how programmed everyone is to believe what they believe and doesnt like it. He also doesn’t like Soma Holidays (euphemism for dropping a pill and escaping reality for awhile.) This puts him at odds with The Director who administrates the “hatchery�? (ie test tube baby factory) and conditioning center (place where all children are conditioned to live in a peaceful society- mostly through subliminal hypnosis.) The director sets about to have Bernard sent off to Iceland for his abnormal thinking only to be foiled by his own hypocrisy. You see fathering or birthing a baby by means other than test tube is considered vulgar, embarrassing and pornographic. But guess what skeleton The Director has in his closet? A son fathered unbeknownst to him. When Bernard stumbles across the Director’s son on a Savage Reservation- places deemed unfit or too expensive to “civilize�? �? Bernard finds his means of averting his Icelandic exile. In the process he becomes a media star- through bringing John Savage, the director’s forgotten child, to civilization. At first John is excited to meet this brave new world, however he quickly becomes disillusioned by fame and the weirdness all around him. Even Lenina, the pull to bring him into civilization is not enough as, despite her own small peculiarity of desiring monogamy, cannot fully comprehend John’s need for individuality in her World State of mind. In the end he gives into societal demands- and unable to live with himself, takes his own life. There’s so much in this book, I’ve really only brushed the surface, but you get the idea: \"We can make a new one (sic* person) with the greatest ease-as many as we like. Unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual; it strikes at Society itself.- Aldous Huxley, Brave New World, Ch. 10\" I think I’m drawn to books such as these because, for some reason, I’ve always felt like I didn’t quite fit in- not in build and not in thinking. When someone’s different, they’ll always feel alone because society will always gravitate to what’s familiar and ostracize what is not. On occasion I like the idea of being reminded that it’s ok and even desired to be an individual. Brave New World was one such reminder. ...more","review Weirdly rife with homoeroticism, even though the most explicit was edited out apparently, A Picture of Dorian Gray is mostly about Oscar Wilde’s musin Weirdly rife with homoeroticism, even though the most explicit was edited out apparently, A Picture of Dorian Gray is mostly about Oscar Wilde’s musings on beauty, art and letting go of morals. I hated that most of the women in the story were vapid- even the outwardly ugly ones. (C\u0027mon, surely they could\u0027ve been thrown a bone?? I mean really, not a single woman of worth to be had??? Someone didnt like their Mama very much.) I didn’t like Harry much, seemed a predator to me, and tho I initially liked Dorian Gray- his lack of good judgment, backbone and eventual cruelty changed all that... however, when we saw the first alteration of the portrait, the story started clicking for me. It begins with a beautiful young Dorian Gray sitting for an artist. After seeing the painting, and listening to another older man extol the virtues of youth and hedonism, he unconsciously makes a sort of deal with the devil to stay young forever by acknowledging the older man’s advice to, and I paraphrase, “don’t resist and just go with it�? when opportunities to debauch arise. Dorian’s face will never show the ravages of living by cruel means, and never grow old- because all of it will be thrust onto the image in the painting. But, as always, the easy way out is only a trap that leads to death. And it indeed ensnared Dorian. For me, with The Picture of Dorian Gray, Wilde does an excellent job of displaying the fact that freedom from, rather than of, moral stricture leads to destruction and true ugliness- which one can assume by the author’s lifestyle, is quite the opposite of what he was attempting to say. In the end the story became a cautionary tale on such a lifestyle and ultimately a prophetic symbol of Oscar Wilde’s own life, imo. Tragic. Lately, as I read the headlines, I just want to scream from my rooftops- Suck it up people, opposite of what the hedonistic lifestyle of the 60’s, 70’s \u0026 80’s tried to tell us, and as much as nihilists would like it otherwise, we need law and a modicum of restraint or you will never experience the true joys in life. Sacrificing your wants, instead of sacrificing your children’s needs (and lives) on the altar of inconvenience, preferring someone else above yourself, and selfless kindness is the purest expression of beauty and one that this “civilized�? society needs to revisit- pronto. You take that away and you have young men murdering each other on the streets, as well as defenseless mothers and daughters being slaughtered in their own homes without impunity. You have mothers abandoning their babies in dumpsters- or even worse hacking them up or drowning them! You have people eating other people’s faces off- literally-and sicko old men preying on children, with no justice for the victims. My soul is burdened by such things right now. Take it from Dorian Gray, when temptation comes to choose outward beauty over the milk of human kindness, its always best to choose the latter. ...more","review I did enjoy this book. I\u0027m a sucker for allegory and this children\u0027s tale is full of it, altho heavy handedly. Written in the late 50\u0027s early 60\u0027s, ac I did enjoy this book. I\u0027m a sucker for allegory and this children\u0027s tale is full of it, altho heavy handedly. Written in the late 50\u0027s early 60\u0027s, according to the author, she had a difficult time getting it published because the powers that be felt it was too difficult for children to grasp. While writing the book, she would read what she had written that day to her own young kids and they anxiously anticipated each reading so she knew it would fly. Finally she was able to get it published and the rest is history. I loved the protag Meg, covered under glasses and braces this 13 yr old has an enormous amount of emotions and cleverness- just not so that everyone can see. When her equally odd genius-but in a different way- little brother leads she and a new friend to three even odder old ladies, they had no idea that they were about to embark on an adventure through space, time, and dimensions of other worlds into the heart of darkness that shadows the soul of earth. Typical Christian themes run throughout the rest of the story- themes of faith overcoming fear, acquiring the ability to see what is not seen, and most importantly... love and sacrifice will always conquer evil. CS Lewis did it better of course with The Chronicles of Narnia, but this one did make me tear up a bit in the end. As a side note: Oddly this book is on the Frequently Challenged/ Banned books list, because idiots who obviously have no ability to understand below the surface of a thing, (and believe me when I tell you this one aint that deep!), look at some of the characters and think \"on no they are witches, they must be of the devil\" rather than the angels they really are! (ugh) Apparently also a bit disturbing to them was the fact that Jesus is mentioned in a category of importance along WITH other religious figures and important people throughout history ala Buddha and Shakespeare. Small minded idiots, because this book was the most pro-Christian book I\u0027ve read in a long time! (People need to actually READ a book before they start challenging stuff. UGH) I listened to A Wrinkle in Time on audio, read by the author herself, which I always like because you get the idea of the characters real voices... unfortunately she has a lisp and its rather hard to ignore it at times to pay attention to the story!
