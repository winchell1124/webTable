The aim of this bug day is to clear as many Amarok bugs as possible. Our target for triage is bugs listed in bugs.kde.org under the product Amarok. The goal of this bug-day is to check for bugs that are fixed, duplicates, are not going to be fixed in Amarok 1.4.x or are already fixed/implemented in Amarok 2. This will enable the Amarok developers to deal with bugs more easily, and so have more time left to actually code on Amarok 2. When you have closed or commented on a bug, please list it in the appropriate section below, so that a second triager can see if they can confirm it.
