College about enforcing the use of calliagnosia, a device that makes it impossible to users to prejudice against others based on facial beauty. Chiang turned down a Hugo nomination for his short story “Liking What You See�? in 2003, on the grounds that the story was rushed due to editorial pressure and did not turn out as he had really wanted, and maybe the part about it not turning out the way he wanted is true, but I didn’t think it was rushed at all. In fact, I thought it was fabulous, which is high praise considering I had to write a writing placement essay over “Liking What You See�? for college. I was thought science fiction could not be properly execute in short story format because they take a lot of time to set up and explain; however, Chiang manages to do it in less that twenty pages. The story is inventive, yet still related to our lives, and posses a lot of questions, but doesn’t give a lot of answers. I’m quite interested in reading more of his short stories, particularly the ones in Stories of Your Life and Others, where “Liking What You See�? was originally published. ...more","review Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two makes four. Yet in the city of London located in Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain) �? a provinc Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two makes four. Yet in the city of London located in Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain) �? a province of the superstate Oceania (formerly known as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom) �? men and women are denied that freedom by a political system called English Socialism, also known as Ingsoc in the government’s invented language, Newspeak. At the head of this political system is Big Brother, and Big Brother says two plus two makes five or three or, really, whatever Big Brother wants because Big Brother decides what is truth. History is controlled by the Ministry of Truth, which is where the protagonist of the novel Winston Smith works rewriting newspaper articles so the historical record always supports the current party line. Those who question Big Brother or presume to insist two plus two makes four are often turned in by their neighbors and children, persecuted for “thoughtcrimes�?, and tortured by the Ministry of Love. While Oceania is in a state of perpetual war, the Ministry of Abundance continues to tell the starving masses that agricultural yields and production levels continue to climb higher and higher. Now that I have finished this novel, I’m wondering how and why I left it languishing on my to-read list for so many years. It truly is the masterpiece people claim it to be and I should not have resisted reading this novel for as long as I did. The intricacies of the political system Orwell creates is particularly thought-provoking, and I found myself pausing the audiobook so I could ponder over a small detail Winston introduces into his narration. Although the year 1984 has long since passed, the message of this novel continues to resonate today, particularly as media outlets position themselves as supportive or critical of one political party and present the historical record in a certain light to reflect poorly on the opposing political party. It is often stated that history is written by the victor, but is the record being continuously rewritten by each new regime? Is war a tool to motivate the economy? Is fear utilized by the political elite to control the masses and continue to perpetrate the need for war? Certainly, I can come up with examples to confirm the truth of all three questions in today’s society showing just how applicable the message of Orwell’s novel continues to be. This is the second audiobook I have listed to narrated by Frank Muller, but this is the first where his narration really stood out in my mind. His ability to convey Winston’s anxiety and fear with the inflection of his voice caused me to tense, to feel those same emotions that the rather stark narrative might have caused me to miss. ...more","review The Handmaid’s Tale is absolutely terrifying, and when I turned the final page I was grateful -- grateful that this is not my life. It’s scary how pla The Handmaid’s Tale is absolutely terrifying, and when I turned the final page I was grateful -- grateful that this is not my life. It’s scary how plausible this world is, how this has actually happening in other countries. “I wish this story were different. I wish it were more civilized. I wish it showed me in a better light, if not happier, then at least more active, less hesitant, less distracted by trivia. I wish it had more shape. I wish it were about love, or about sudden realizations important to one\u0027s life, or even about sunsets, birds, rainstorms, or snow�? I\u0027m sorry there is so much pain in this story. I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s in fragments, like a body caught in a crossfire or pulled apart by force. But there is nothing I can do to change it.�? Offred is a handmaid, or, in her own words, “a uterus on two legs.�? It’s her job to present The Wife, and the country of Gilead, with a child. Her name -- her real name -- has been lost; she’s only known as “Offred,�? a combination of “of�? and “Fred.�? I can’t tell you how long it took me to figure that out, but it means that women are property. Handmaids have no identity. Yet, Offred remembers life when she had a husband, Luke, and a daughter, who was taken to be someone else’s child, and what it was like to wear short skirts and running shoes rather than a red dress that screams to everyone who sees her that she’s a baby factory by trade. “I am thirty-three years old. I have brown hair. I stand five seven without shoes. I have trouble remembering what I used to look like. I have viable ovaries. I have more chance.�? {pg. 143} Women can also be Marthas, servants in the houses of important men; Wives, bitter women angry over the shame of marriages and the chronically unfaithfulness of their husbands, which is required by the government, but still yearn to be mothers; prostitutes; or handmaids, which is worse than prostitution because their sole purpose is procreation and they’re forced to give up the children they have. Handmaids are given three chances to have a child before they are banished as “Unwomen.�? Ironic ally, the majority of Wives cannot have children, yet are not “unwomen.�? “You are a transitional generation, said Aunt Lydia. It is the hardest for you. We know the sacrifices you are being expected to make. It is hard when men revile you. For the ones who come after you, it will be easer. They will accept their duties with willing hearts. She did not say: Because they will have no memories, of any other way. She said: Because they won’t want things they can’t have.�? {pg. 117} There are a few things I disliked about this book. Atwood’s writing is a little clunky with things progressing a little too rapidly, and I’m still not sure how I much I like Offred’s story being told in first person with a large amount of commentary. It’s almost like Atwood couldn’t make up her mind as to how to tell the story, and while it’s supposed to be the transcripts of tapes, there’s still something off about it -- like Offred was telling her into a tape recorder as it was happening. It’s still eerie and thought-provoking, a book I think is important to read. However, The Handmaid’s Tale could have used a bit more fleshing out as some of the details aren’t clear and the narrative a little clunky and jumpy. ...more","review Animal Farm is, hands down, one of my favorite books.

In fact, my copy is missing the back cover; it fell off somewhere between reread number eleven and twelve. I was introduced to Orwell’s most popular work during my sophomore year of high school, and it’s because Animal Farm that I found the real beauty in symbolism that smacks you in the face or is subtly placed. For those who aren’t familiar with the novel, the animals on a farm in England rise up against their cruel owner and farmer, Mr. Jones, which represents Tsar Nicholas II and The Bolsheviks Revolution. They take over the farm and rename it Animal Farm, which represents USSR, due to a vision given to them by Old Major, a pig who dies almost immediately after the uprising. In keeping with Orwell’s own socialist beliefs, Old Major’s idea is muddled by another pig, Napoleon, who represents Joseph Stalin. The other animals represent the citizens of USSR, and Animal Farm delves into how absolute power corrupts absolutely. It’s a wonderful, well-written critique of the communist regime, but also delves into how socialist ideals are corrupted and twisted by power-hungry people, which makes them unappealing for Americans especially. Animal Farm shows how important education is in order to keep yourself safe, and can speak to people both individually and as a group as “absolute power corrupts absolutely�? relates to situations I’ve been through and through local, state, national, and international governments. ...more","review I’ve heard repeatedly that The Host is “science fiction for people who don’t like science fiction.�? Well, I don’t like science fiction, so I considere I’ve heard repeatedly that The Host is “science fiction for people who don’t like science fiction.�? Well, I don’t like science fiction, so I considered myself a part of the target audience and I checked it out of the library. And you know what, I liked it. Sure, I struggled in the beginning to get into the story and I certainly do think The Host could have been shorter by a hundred or so pages. {I actually got a hand cramp from trying to hold this book open towards the end.} But it quickly picks up speed. The last two hundred or so pages are the best part of this novel, but overall the story kept me engaged and I sped through it pretty quickly. “But I’d never looked at the situation from the body’s perspective before; no other planet had forced me to. A body that didn’t function right was quickly and painlessly disposed of because it was as useless as a car that could not run. What was the point f keeping it around? There were conditions of the mind, too, that made a body unusable: dangerous mental addictions, malevolent yearnings, things that could not be healed and made the body unsafe to others. Or, of course, a mind with a will too strong to be erased.�? {pg. 286} Meyer did a better job of developing more likable and well-developed characters than in the Twilight Saga, although she did under-develop Maggie, Sharon, and Jared to a degree. Creativity was at the forefront of this novel; I especially enjoyed all of planets Wanderer - later dubbed Wanda - taught about. I think she did a fantastic job of showing how complex the problem was and how muddle the lines between right and wrong became. “But what if it were you?�? Ian asked in little more than a whisper. “What if you were stuffed in a human body and let loose on the planet, only to find yourself lost among your own kind? What if you were such a good…person that you tried to save the life you’d taken, that you almost died trying to get her back to her family? What if you then found yourself surrounded by violent aliens who hated you and hurt you and tried to murder you, over and over again?�? his voice faltered momentarily. “What if you just kept doing whatever you could to save and heal these people despite that? Wouldn’t you deserve a life, too? Wouldn’t you have earned that much?�? {pg. 384} My biggest complaint was that the ending was so painfully obvious. I pretty much figured out exactly how things were going to be wrapped up by quarter mark. I didn’t like how Wanda lies about her age, but I’m realizing that’s a common theme in Meyer’s books. The love triangle started to become a little grating towards the end, but I could forgive it. Really, it’s just how obvious the ending is that annoyed me. On a side note, though, I really don’t see how The Host is adult literature. Twilight was way more graphic - especially in Breaking Dawn - and certainly had more sexual tension. One could even argue that the kisses in Twilight were much more descriptive than in The Host. ...more","review None","review In this imaginative retelling of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, Hannah Payne awakens to find her skin is now the red �? the color of blood. In this imaginative retelling of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, Hannah Payne awakens to find her skin is now the red �? the color of blood. She is a convicted criminal sentenced by the State of Texas, who criminalized abortion as murder, to be “chromed�?, and her skin color has been genetically modified to broadcast to the world her crime. Hannah devoted her life to church and family before her arrest, but her crime and her refusal to name both the father of her baby and the abortionist leads all but her father and her sister to turn their backs on her and earns Hannah the maximum sentence. In this dystopian society, jails were considered too great a strain on society and closed so Hannah is to spend her sentence out in society where anyone can take one look at her and know her crime. Female reds are rare, but the world is filled with yellows, which indicate a misdemeanor offense, and blues �? child molesters �? are even rare with groups like The Fist around. This vigilant band to which her abusive brother-in-law belongs murders blues, yellows, reds, and greens while the rest of society turns a blind eye. While Canada considers America’s program of “chroming�? to be immoral, the religious fervor sweeping across America following the Scourge, an epidemic that left most of the world infertile and was blamed on female promiscuity, supports the program and pushes for laws that encouraging patriarchy and criminalize abortion. Reverend Aidan Dale, Hannah’s former pastor at the Chuck of the Ignited Word in Plano, is now the Secretary of Faith for the president and seen as the steward of America’s morality, but those familiar with Hawthorne’s original tale will know how impossible that is. The confrontational nature of this book towards patriarchal understandings of religion, the criminalization of abortion, and the imposed Christian religiosity on the government and the American people is superbly done because of the way it is presented through Hannah’s eyes. This twenty-something woman has spent her entire life believing her only, God-sanction role in life is to become a wife and mother and waits for marriage under the authority of her parents. She does not spend the book raging against the confines of this society but rather seeing how much this society rages against her and, therefore, causing her to question her understanding of crime, punishment, and religion. Such a conflict �? young adults contemplating the religion their parents have raised them �? occurs on a smaller scale across the world and adds a realm of realism to this dystopian tale. Having lived in Texas, I also found it well within the realm of possibility that the state would criminalize abortion, if given the chance, and pass laws to impress an extremely conservative view of Christianity on its residences even without the Scourge. It is an easy extension of today’s current political climate and fights occuring across the United States in legislative bodies and courts. Jordan’s addition of melachroming adds another layer of complexity to this well-developed dystopian world and raises questions about criminality and how society perceives criminals that compliments rather than distracts from Hannah’s story. And given my own decisive opinions on abortion and religion, it gave me something more to examine and question as I listened to the book. The singular downside to narrative for me was the addition of a lesbian encounter between Hannah and Simone. I resent the suggestion that a personal, religiously-based awakening immediately leads to a homosexual relationship. Jordan does a disservice to the purpose of her book with this addition as it could be taken as confirmation of the fears of many conservatives that a less fundamentalist adherence to religion will lead to their children becoming gay. I also did not love the narration by Heather Corrigan as I could barely tolerate the sound of her voice, but I was willing to listen to her voice for nearly eleven hours in order to hear more of Jordan’s imaginative tale. ...more","review (If Goodreads allowed half stars, I would give this one 3.5 stars. I rounded up because of the strong beginning and my interest in learning more about (If Goodreads allowed half stars, I would give this one 3.5 stars. I rounded up because of the strong beginning and my interest in learning more about this intriguing world.) A woman in my book club spent ten minutes of a recent meeting trying to convince all of us to read Howey’s novel. Her suggestion was shot down because the book is too new and, therefore, difficult for people to acquire (I spent nearly six weeks on the waitlist for one of the sixteen copies at my public library). I decided to read it based on her effusive praise and her statement that her brother and her cousin, neither of whom are readers, read this book in two days and have not stopped talking about it. In Howey’s dystopian world, men and women live in silos tolling their days below or above ground depending upon their role in the community. The “uppers�? live in the top part of the silo serving as the mayor, sheriff and deputies, or in the IT department while the “mids�? �? so-called because they living in the middle of the silo �? work as doctors, nurses, or on one of the hydroponic farms and those on the lowest floors work in the mines or in the machinery shop. The later rarely make the journey up to the top of the silo unwilling �? or, more likely, unwelcomed �? to take in the view at the top of the desolate, acidic landscape outside through the single window. A window onto a shattered city that must be cleaned and maintained to prevent erosion from the environment outside the silo’s walls; a task that falls to those accused of treason against the silo for no one has ever survived a cleaning. While no one has ever refused to clean when they get outside the silo’s walls, Holston, the first to volunteer to clean, is determined to be the first to do so. The greatest intrigue of this novel is the setting in which it is placed, and I have to applaud Howey for taking something as mundane as a grain silo and turning it into something so imaginative. I do object to the idea that the silo is located in Atlanta, Georgia given the resources used to maintain the silo and the jobs that provide said resources, but it is minor detail in the face of a highly-detailed, highly-structured society created by Howey. While the novel appears at first glance to be a critique of environmental degradation, it is actually a thorough critique of technology and its ability to distort perceptions of reality. The novel is broken into five parts and each part gains a new main character �? Holston, the sheriff of the silo; Jahns, the silo\u0027s mayor, and Marnes, her deputy; Juliette, a mechanic promoted to sheriff; Solo, who I cannot describe without spoiling the novel; and Lukas, a IT worker. The shift in focus is difficult to appreciate at times; I began to care about one character only to be told I must care about another right away. The sense of loss becomes an unnecessary drag on the narrative and was never replaced by the hatred or fear I was supposed to have for the villain of the novel because of how much of a caricature he was. He could not have been more obvious if was he twirling a handlebar mustache. Fairly well paced, the novel moves forward through a series of events with cleanings of the window (and, therefore, the silo) demarcating the end of several sections of the novel. It becomes an intriguing question of who will be next and why that I found myself racing towards that eventually unfolds into what happens when someone refuses to clean for the first time. More information about the past of the society �? how and why it was founded �? begins to open up to the reader, and I ended up enjoying those chapters more so than the ones covering life outside the silo. The novel, thus, goes through a series of ups and downs in terms of enjoyment, particularly when a whole slew of characters are introduces at the end with little resolution, and I’m sure I will pick up the next two books in the series in the new future. ...more","review Quite possibly the biggest book on the blogosphere this year, The Hunger Games is a fantastic, fast-paced, and compelling read that managed to keep me Quite possibly the biggest book on the blogosphere this year, The Hunger Games is a fantastic, fast-paced, and compelling read that managed to keep me on the edge of my seat every time I picked it up. I can see why the novel has garnished so many positive �? and sometimes gushing �? reviews. I loved Katniss, even though I have no idea how to pronounce her name; I loved her spunk, her love of her family, and her attitude that seemed appropriate at every moment. Peeta, Gale, Prim, Cinna, Haymitch, and Effie all round out this wonderful, quirky, and real cast of characters. However, as I got farther and farther into the story, I could help but draw similarities to a movie I saw sophomore year �? “Battle Royale.�? Yes, the premises are slightly different; “Battle Royale�? is about forty Japanese school children who are suddenly forced to compete against one another to the death, while The Hunger Games are about districts who are forced to essentially sacrifice two children to the Capital in order to crush any dreams of an uprising. But both deals with police states where one can be shot for a minor infraction, both deal with children who must fight to the death on television, and both deal with two competitors who fall in love with one another. There are an alarming amount of similarities, and while I don’t want to say Collins copied the plot, I just can’t ignore them. There are also several sentences that just made me cringe with the lack of proper syntax, and I was able to put the book down twice without second thought �? once a hundred pages in to go to sleep and then again this afternoon with only fifty pages left to see a movie. Not exactly the making of a “five-star�? book for me. I still think it is great read, and was a lot easier to stomach than “Battle Royale,�? which is also a novel by the same name by Koushun Takami. I’m anticipating the sequel, Catching Fire, and cannot wait to see where Collins takes me next. ...more","review In the final installment of Collins�? dystopian series, Katniss Everdeen �? the “Girl on Fire�?, the Mockingjay �? has now become the symbol of a revoluti In the final installment of Collins�? dystopian series, Katniss Everdeen �? the “Girl on Fire�?, the Mockingjay �? has now become the symbol of a revolution following her disastrous rescue from the destroyed arena of the Quarter Quell. Separated from Peeta and Johanna, Katniss is reunited with her mother, sister, and Gale in the one district the Capital claimed to have destroyed and utilized as an example of what could occur in the other twelve districts did not obey. Yet District Thirteen, which used to provide the Capital with its military technology, had merely gone underground bidding its time and preparing for war once the other districts decided to rise up against the Capital. Led by President Cain, the district wants to utilize Katniss in order to keep the momentum towards revolution going and are willing to bend to her demands �? that Peeta and Johanna be pardoned of all crimes, that her sister get to keep her cat, that Katniss gets to kill President Snow �? in order to finally take down the capital. My reaction to Collins�? series has been rather mixed. I loved the first book in the series but found the wait for the second heavily dampened my appreciation of it when I finally got my hands on a copy, and then I waited four years after publication to finally read the conclusion. This might be one of the rare instances where I like the film adaptations more than the books as the films add more intrigue and characterization that the original books do. Katniss is one of the more difficult narrators I have encountered. I love that the protagonist is a narrator, but Collins does not have a very good handle on her narrator and the present tense she tells the story in. Her narration lacks the immediacy and the intimacy often found with present tense. This lack of intimacy affects the emotional range Katniss possess; the love triangle feels rather a forced as a result. I also find Katniss is far too meta for her own good because rather than allowing the symbolism offered by our first-person narrator to speak for herself, she insists upon explaining how the metaphor or the symbolism represents her in that moment. Trapped in an underground bunker and unable to leave, Katniss entertains the other residents of District 13 with a game of “Crazy Cat�? where she shines a flashlight against the wall in enticement for the cat to chase it. She then goes on to explain how this game represents the game she is involved in with President Snow, how the people of the other twelve districts were trapped and distracted from rising up by the Hunger Games. Personally, I found this explanation (which is an example of a larger phenomenon throughout the text) to be unnecessary and a bit like sitting through English courses in school where the teacher would insist upon analyzing the obvious. The novel is, of course, geared towards young adults but I think Collins underestimates the reading comprehension of her readers. Not everything needs to be spelled out and explained. My favorite aspect of this novel is the ambiguous conclusion of the conflict. Katniss�? struggle for truth in an area that is not black and white and the manipulation of her image for the sake of war is one the more important lessons about war that Collins can teach her young readers. Too bad much of it was overshadowed by a poorly constructed and executed love triangle which, again, I think the film has handled better. ...more","review Imagine if two percent of the world’s population disappeared on October 14th? No virus. No war. One minute your brother, neighbor, coworker is there a Imagine if two percent of the world’s population disappeared on October 14th? No virus. No war. One minute your brother, neighbor, coworker is there and the next? Poof �? gone. Three years later, the residents of Mapleton are still struggling to make sense of the sudden disappearance of their loved ones. The town’s reverend has launched a slanderous campaign to prove the event was not the Rapture because the people who disappeared could not possibly be worthy of God’s love. Others have channeled their attention on moving forward, on refusing to dwell on events that cannot be explained must to the dissatisfaction of the Guilty Remnant. Dressed in all-white, traveling in pairs, and smoking incessantly, members of the cult-like Guilty Remnant monitor the people of Mapleton silently reminding people of what they are choosing to forget. Perrotta’s novel specifically focuses on the Garvey family and how they and the people closest to them deal with the fallout. Kevin, Mapleton’s new mayer, wants to move his community forward and channel their grief into a single day of remembrance, but his wife and son are unable to move on as quickly as he. Tom fixates on the disappearance of someone he once knew in grade school, someone he hasn’t spoken to in years dropping out of college to follow a self-proclaimed prophet, Holy Wayne, who claims to absorb people’s pain and abuses young, Asian girls in the name of his special gift. Laurie, who was visiting with her best friend when said friend’s daughter disappeared, joins the Guilty Remnant willingly choosing to severe all ties with her family, including her teenage daughter, Jill, who changes her entire image in order to deal with the changes. The only non-Garvey focused on in this book is Nora Durst, who lost her husband and her toddler children on October 14th. Still reeling from the tragedy, Nora rations out episodes of “Spongebob Squarepants�?, her son’s favorite show, and tries to move forward through her relationship with Kevin. But that is more difficult than she anticipated, especially given the temptation to see her missing husband and children as more than perfect. I tried to convince my book club that members of the Guily Remnant, who states that their purpose is to reject society, smoke cigarettes as a way to get society to reject them in turn. The idea donned on me as I was walking home from work watching people speed up to pass smokers or hold their breath while waiting for the light to change in an obvious rejection of the behavior of the person next to them, and it was an idea that stayed with me long after Perrotta finally explained the group’s decision to smoke. My book club rejected this idea in favor of Perrotta’s explanation, but this example ultimately demonstrates the most interesting and frustrating thing about this book: the answers are few and far between. I expected there to be more answers �? I’m still trying to figure out if the rapture was truly the rapture �? and it took me a few days and a book club discussion to realize the purpose of the novel is to explore human nature in the wake of an unexplainable tragedy. In this case, there is no one to blame (unless you choose to blame God), no cause to explain why people left so how does society move forward? The gravitation to Holy Wayne and the reaction of the reverend are the two responses I felt were most accurate and, personally, I wish Perrotta has spent more time on them rather than on Laurie. It is hard to support both Nora and Laurie because Laurie chooses to abandon her family despite the fact that she didn’t lose anyone within her immediate family. At least, not the same sense that Nora lost her family, and the juxtaposition between the two characters is incredibly frustrating. What is even more frustrating is the way this novel peters out. I expected some kind of climax and while in the context of the story Perrotta is trying to tell the ending makes sense, I felt like it ended on an underwhelming and weak note. The beginning, however, is very engaging, and I can appreciate a good character study now and then. ...more","review Even before Uglies won my little poll, I was already cracking the cover and diving right on into Tally’s world. In Tally’s world -- a dystopian world Even before Uglies won my little poll, I was already cracking the cover and diving right on into Tally’s world. In Tally’s world -- a dystopian world -- anyone normal is ugly and the only way to find true happiness is to undergo one radical operation after another. Children start out as littles -- small and adorable -- but as soon as they hit their preteens, they suddenly morph into ugly, emotional beings. “But it’s a trick, Tally. You’ve only seen pretty faces your whole life. Your parents, your teachers everyone over sixteen. But you weren’t born expecting that kind of beauty in everyone, all the time. You just got programmed into thinking anything else is ugly.�? {pg. 82} If you can’t already tell, Uglies�? premise is commentary on how preteens and teens feel about themselves, but it’s also commentary on the way we run the world. The “Ruties�? -- people who damaged the world through burning oil, mowing down complete forests, and over-hunting, over-populating -- are completely vilified by the Uglies, the example of how they have risen above Americans and a better society. And I thought it was completely original on how we fall. “Everyone judged everyone else based on their appearance. People who were taller got better jobs, and people even voted for some politicians just because they weren’t quite as ugly as everybody else. Blah, blah, blah.�? “Yeah, and people killed one another over stuff like having different skin color.�? Tally shook her head. No matter how many times they repeated it at school, she’d never really quite believe that one. “So what if people look more alike now? It’s the only way to make people equal.�? {pg. 44-45} On the other hand, while I liked the story, I thought some of the story was lacking that spark that would have made it great. The dialogue was pretty dry, and at times I thought that teens would never phrase things like that. And Tally, for instance, just came across as kind of whiny. I realize she has to be naïve in order for the story to work, but she doesn’t need to be naïve and whiny. I did think her personal struggle to come to grips with the truth about the operations was very well-written; it was believable and interesting. David and Shay were clearly the better characters, and the hope their development continues throughout the trilogy. The only other thing that bugged me was how dated the writing was. Yes, the book was published in 2005, but I felt like a lot of the futuristic ideas (holograms, hovercrafts) had already been written about in Star Trek, Star Wars, and the like. ...more","review None","review None","review None","review **spoiler alert** Apparently being pretty also means you use the words “bubbly�? and “bogus.�?

Have we suddenly been transported back to the 1990s? I have to admit, every time Tally or Zane or Shay or anyone used the words “bubbly�? and “bogus,�? I rolled my eyes. Which means I was rolling my eyes for ninety percent of this book. I was pretty disappointed with Pretties; there isn’t much plot difference between it and Uglies. In Uglies, Tally want to be pretty, and in Pretties, Tally wants to be a Crim. Tally fights with Shay, escapes to the Smoke, gets lost along the way only be saved by another group she didn’t know existed, reaches the Smoke, and then betrays the Smokies. The only difference is Tally discovers how the cure David’s mother created at the end of Uglies works and the social experiment the doctors in Tally’s world run. And while it was nice to undersand more about Tally’s world, it just isn’t enough to carry Pretties. Oh, and instead of David making Tally’s heart going pitter-patter, it’s Zane, who always felt a little off to me. I just wasn’t hooked by the second book in this trilogy, and I’m hoping the third book, Specials, redeems this series for me. My friend Helen ranks the series as Specials, Uglies, Extras, and then Pretties, so I know I’m not alone. ...more","review Oryx and Crake was an extra assignment given to me by my Political Science Fiction professor after I went to her and told I was “understimulated�? (her Oryx and Crake was an extra assignment given to me by my Political Science Fiction professor after I went to her and told I was “understimulated�? (her words, not mine) by my classes. At the time we were about to start The Handmaid’s Tale, which I read this past May and enjoyed, and upon mentioning this fact, she instructed me to read Atwood’s finalist for the 2003 Booker Prize and the 2003 Governor General’s Award. Since she listened the audio book, her plan was that I would read it and upon finishing it, we’d compare notes. I’m interested in what she’ll have to say about her experience listening because my experience reading certainly does not match up to her previous statements. Needless to say, I struggled to enjoy Atwood’s science fiction novel. Snowman, the main character and perceivably the only human left living, is the caretaker of the Crakers, or the Children of Crake, the mad scientist of this tale. Complicating this story, though, are the friendship between Snowman (also known as Jimmy) and Crake �? formulated in their youth, this friendship struggles to last through college after Crake heads to the prestigious Watson-Crick Institute and Snowman to the arts-based Martha Graham Academy �? and each boy’s relationship with Oryx, the character we’re given the least insight into. Originally, Oryx’s mother sells her to a man who blackmails others for trying to have s*x with her; later, she’s passed along to a child p*rnographer and the video she “stars�? in is the first time Snowman and Crake see her. The video haunts Snowman; it’s barely a blimp on Crake’s screen. After landing a job at a biotech corporation, Crake creates both the Crakers �? innocent and peaceful, these genetically engineered humans are herbivores whose, um, parts turn blue during their limited breeding seasons �? and a genetic pandemic that, apparently, kills all humans except for Snowman. His final product, though, provides the climax of this tale. I liked the concepts behind the novel �? corporate parasitism, ethics, humanity, science over arts, genetic engineering �? and I thought quite a bit of it was a reflection of life today. Of course, this is the whole point of science fiction novels, and I would have been disappointed if this had not been the case with Oryx and Crake. One thing I did noticed, though, was the similarities between Atwood’s novel and several I have read for my political science fiction class. For example, in “The Product of the Extremes�? by Brenda W. Clough, a genetically-based pill eliminates racism and, ultimately, race; in Oryx and Crake, Crake believes the BlyssPluss pill will eliminate racism. It will certainly make a good talking point when I meet with my professor on Friday. So what didn’t I like about this tale? I really struggled to get into the novel because I didn’t like any of the characters. Crake was too much of a mad scientist, Snowman rubbed me the wrong way, and Oryx played both men. Ultimately, though, it was the lack of information and lack of characterization of all three main characters that bother me. Structurally speaking, Oryx and Crake suffers from being both physically too long and from taking too long for the story to move forward. The whole thing is told in flashbacks as Snowman reminisces as the Crakers pester him for stories of their creator. The vulgarity and the fact that sex was everywhere in this novel really turned me off to it. As boys, Snowman and Crake play “Kwiktime Osama,�? which mimics the actions of its reference, and “Blood and Roses,�? a graphic video game where players play historical rivals and battle to the bloody, gory death. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Commentary on today? Of course. Unnecessarily nauseating? Resoundingly yes. And I still don’t understand Crake’s motivations for his actions; there’s no clear reasoning for anything that happens, and that’s ultimately this novel’s downfall despite the open ending. Apparently The Year of the Flood, which was released towards the end of last month, is the follow-up to Oryx and Crake, but I don’t plan on reading it. ...more","review **spoiler alert** Dystopian Chicago is divided and ruled by five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue -- Candor (the hon **spoiler alert** Dystopian Chicago is divided and ruled by five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue -- Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). Each year, sixteen-year-olds from each faction must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. An aptitude test helps guide their choice, but ultimately each person must make the decision between staying with their family or moving to a different faction better suited for their abilities. After her aptitude test comes back as \"divergent\" (showing that she has an aptitude for more than one of these faction), Beatrice Prior chooses the one faction no one expected her to pick, renames herself Tris, and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to become a member of the Dauntless faction. But she still feels the pull of the family she left behind at Abnegation, the concern for the brother who chose Erudite, and the beginnings of love with one member of her faction, and it quickly becomes apparent that she and her world can no longer coexist as five factions. My roommate handed me this book right as I was leaving for the airport telling me it would be the easy, enjoyable read I need as a break from grad school. I buried it into my suitcase pulling it only out at the end of my trip in expectation that the inevitable fight between the factions would help keep me awake through the last few hours of my transatlantic flight. It, unfortunately, did not work. The heroine, Tris, is the standard heroine of every young adult novel today -- nondescript, clumsy, doesn\u0027t think highly of herself. Supposedly, writing the heroine in this way allows readers to imagine themselves in the scenario, but a dystopian novel demands more in terms of descriptions to sell the new world. Why are authors not writing heroines who believe in themselves, who have more to say about who they are than that they\u0027re clumsy? I never knew a teenage girl who did not suffer from low self-esteem -- myself included -- and yet each of us could say something more descriptive about ourselves than that we\u0027re clumsy or not a traditional beauty. Roth\u0027s novel has often been described as the next Hunger Games, but the more apt comparison would be to Lois Lowry\u0027 The Giver. Both examine a dystopian society where people\u0027s lives and careers are determined by an aptitude test, where the main character\u0027s test comes back inconclusive and thus becomes the catalyst for change within the society. I could not shake this comparison will reading, which was a detriment to Roth\u0027s novel, and the training scenes often compared to The Hunger Games lacked the heart found in Katniss\u0027 journey. Readers familiar with Chicago will pick up on the few references to what the city used to be -- the old EL trains, Lake Michigan as a swamp -- yet the novel is bereft of the sights, sounds, and smells needed to create a vivid image for the reader. I need to be able to imagine Tris and the rest of the dauntless jumping onto the old EL trains; instead, I was imaging a series of faceless people (ironically, how the Abnegation wants you to see people) jumping onto silver bullet trains without any context. For me, though, the inability to understand and believe in the structure of this dystopian novel was its ultimate downfall. Sixteen-year-olds who fail the initiation into their new faction are forced to live in the slums and do menial work the rest of their life receiving only menial help from the Abnegation, who claim to value selflessness but allow people to live in squalor with minimal human interaction. Seems contradictory. Furthermore, the Abnegation run the government for all five factions because they are selfless, but shouldn\u0027t that be the job of Amity since they value peace above all else? The problems at the core of this society seemed obvious; I\u0027m surprised it managed to make it through (at least) a second generation with Tris. ...more","review None","review In 2035, a virus renders everyone under the age of eighteen sterile and teenage pregnancy is not only rampant but encouraged. Sixteen-year-old Melody In 2035, a virus renders everyone under the age of eighteen sterile and teenage pregnancy is not only rampant but encouraged. Sixteen-year-old Melody is still “prebump�? meaning she has yet to become pregnant, but her parents are economists and have negotiated a record-breaking contract for her. Biding her time until a sperm donor can be found, Melody wants to become president of her high school pregnancy club and resents the intrusion of her newly found twin sister, Harmony, into her life. Raised in a religious community, Harmony is determined to save her sister from teenage pregnancy and bring her to live within the community where girls are encouraged to save themselves for marriage. The virus still affects their lives but more twenty- and thirty-year-olds are able to get pregnant than outside the compound, which the community sees as a sign that God is one their side. But a case of mistaken identity destroys everyone’s carefully laid plans and forces both girls to confront the dark side of their upbringing and beliefs. An interesting concept I was excited to read, but finishing this book was one confusing and long slog. The mark of a good dystopian novel is a well-developed world where a problem in this world is twisted to the extreme and addressed. Is the problem teenage pregnancy and the celebration of it in our culture through shows like �?16 and Pregnant�? and “Teen Mom�?? Or, is the problem the strict yet hypersexualized culture of fundamentalist religions? I couldn’t tell. The long lost sisters plot is overused, but I could have overlooked it had the dystopian world and other plot points been more engaging. But because there isn’t one clear problem, the world in McCafferty’s novel is not developed to the point it should be. It would have been easier to follow had McCafferty focused on the religious aspect like Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale or if the author had better developed the world in which Melody lived. More information and details; more explanation and clear writing. For example, the slang used by Melody and Harmony �? words like neggers, cock jockey, fertilicious, rilly �? is over the top; difficult to understand and seemingly inserted in an attempt to show that McCafferty can “write�? teenagers. And what is this virus that renders everyone over eighteen infertile? Where did this virus come from? What is MiWorld? How does it work? If babies are so valuable, then why are girls allowed to get pregnant by their boyfriends or from group orgies? Why are there group orgies? Why are these girls not separated with their reproduction regulated? Obviously, I finished the book with far more questions than answers. And, in the tradition of all young adult novels published lately, the book is written to become a series with a cliffhanger at the end. It’s supposed to encourage me to pick up the next book, but the muddled plot and flat, boring characters certainly doesn’t entice me to do so. ...more","review None","review **spoiler alert** {Even though, as I’ll state farther down, I have no idea really happened in Never Let Me Go, I’m afraid in my confusion that my have **spoiler alert** {Even though, as I’ll state farther down, I have no idea really happened in Never Let Me Go, I’m afraid in my confusion that my have completely and utterly spoiled this one.

Yes, but I can’t help but feel like everyone else knows what exactly was going on with Never Let Me Go and I don’t. Is it social commentary? Quite possibly. After all, I have managed to surmise that these carers were made to serve as personal organ donors for their “possibles,�? that is the ones they are cloned from, in order to prolong human life.

Although, Specials is supposed to document Tally’s transformation and her overcoming her new wiring, but I never felt like she did in the end. However, as it is ultimately the end of the series, it ends with a whimper and doesn’t answer any of the residual questions I had from Pretties or even Uglies. ...more","review None"],["notes","notes
