If it isn\u0027t marked \"testcase\" in the title, make a note of that. Check that the testcase works! (And doesn\u0027t work!) Most importantly, we need to create testcases. These are time-consuming, but extremely useful and really help out developers. These are especially important if it is a site that is either a non-Western language or a site you need some sort of account for. Unclear If something has no clear instructions on how to reproduce it, or has little useful information, add a comment asking the reporter for more detail. Then list it in the bugs awaiting feedback section. Be polite, we want to be nice to our bug reporters! Is it a big bug? Prioritizing is good. If a major website doesn\u0027t work, that is important. Let\u0027s keep track of them. Version field Keep an eye on what the \"Version:\" fields say in Bugzilla. If it says \"unspecified\", change the version field to match what the report says, i.e. to match version the bug was first reported in. Do not change the version number if it is currently set as a number! (ex. from 3.5.2 to 4.0.2) Double Check! Please list bugs here to get a second opinion","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":0,"headerRowIndex":0}
