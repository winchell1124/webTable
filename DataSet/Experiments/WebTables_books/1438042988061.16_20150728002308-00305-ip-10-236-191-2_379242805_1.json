Charlie is able to accept the consequences of his actions. He acknowledges his wrongdoing while in the factory, and relinquishes a potential goldmine, from the sale of his everlasting gobstopper to a rival spy, back to Wonka. The hidden message in this film is one of redemption. It is hidden because it is conveyed through the imagery of the films final scene. Charlie has made it to the end of his journey. Despite his moral struggles, he finds redemption through his desire to correct his mistake. He is given a reward that is beyond his wildest expectations- he is given the keys to the factory while the Wonkavator crashes through the ceiling up into the sky. The allusion to Heaven and salvation is unmistakable.","Ronald Reagan stars as a baseball pitcher who overcomes his problems to help his team win. This was one of Reagan\u0027s own favorites.","Highlights the virtues of strong moral values, with more substance than High Noon.","A brilliant movie that criticizes public schools.","Highlights the bravery of NYC\u0027s firemen and police in 9/11","Main lesson of the film is that Ralph a video game villain who is being the poor and medal-less guy encourages him to use his equal opportunities to do better and pursue his own successes. The basis of the American Dream, the goal of overcoming one\u0027s present, lowly circumstances to achieve a state of greatness; and shows how trying to achieving this goal by theft, is the wrong way to do it. In addition the main villain of the movie is competition-hating villain, who has a pushed liberal values and established what\u0027s like a fixed-economy where in a game only he wins."],["Gross (Domestic)","","$64,167,069","$8,430,492","NA - TV","$19,294,144","Unknown","$ 20,000,000[1]","","$ 172,956,409","Unknown","$ 21,208,358","$304,000,000.","NA - TV","","","$287,594,577","$8,070,537","$ 17,300,000","$ 57,229,890","","$ 242,589,580","$176,654,505","$259,766,572","$ 58,972,904","$190,212,113","$ 30,000,000 (world wide estimate)","$ 7.5 million","$ 291,709,845","$ 141,621,490","$ 104,383,624","$179,033,791","$ 67,253,092","$357,067,947","$","$ 100,853,835","$ 34,522,221","Unknown","$ 533,316,061","$441,053,078","$ 30,041","$25,196,249","$29,647,974","NA - DVD","$ 1,483,975","$ 441,071,011","$103,068,524","$11.5","$ 10,178,331","","$70,136,369","$ 50,000,000","$ 33,451,479","$ 3,744,790","NA - TV","$5,608,651","$ 3,000,000","Unknown","Unknown","$ 12,339,633","$ 238,632,124","$9,244,641","$ 198,676,459","$61,389,680","$8,000,000 (U.S.), $20,000,0000 (worldwide)","$ 11,000,000","$70,906,973","Unknown","$ 19,487,173","unknown revenue","$3,355,000","$2,861,020","$130,724,2000","$ 12,647,089","$292,376","Unknown","$631,442,092","Unknown","$ 2,500,000","$24,159,872 (U.S.)","$ 35,799,026","$357,067,947","Unknown","Unknown","$ 74,541,707","$1,585,994","$ 31,906,454","$181,410,615","$ 312,825,899","$111,543,479","$ 11,286,112","$ 314,776,114","$ 340,478,898","$ 377,027,325","","Unknown","Unknown","$291,045,518","$ 93,926,386","$33,084,249","$169,333,034","$ 310,900","$ 64,445,708","unknown money returns","Unknown","Unknown","unknown","amount made unknown","$ 5,595,706","$37,629,831","Unknown","$14,789,113 (U.S.)","$5,357,328","$ 32,481,825","$ 3,954,651","$ 41,687,243","$ 9,600,000","amount unknown","Unknown","$113,086,868","$119,772,232","$215,294,342[","$84,254,167","$1.046 billion","$ 101,217,900","$307,077,300","Unknown","$242,374,454","$ 35,866,000","$103,412,758","$ 117,235,247","Unknown","$ 22,750,363","$ 32,416,586","$144,833,357, $144,833,357, $144,833,357","$2,800,000","Unknown","","$ 18,875,011","$ 20,000,000","$2,220,008","$42,930,462","$ 43,853,424","$ 158,671,368","$ 403,706,375","$460,998,007","Unknown","$ 65,500,000","Unknown","$ 146,261,000","$ 10,890","$ 3,225,000","$79,258,538","Made for TV","$114,660,784","","$4 million","Unknown","$ 65,500,000","","$ 70,236,496","$189,422,889"]],"pageTitle":"Essay:Greatest Conservative Movies - Conservapedia","title":"","url":"http://www.conservapedia.com/Essay%3AGreatest_Conservative_Movies","hasHeader":true,"headerPosition":"FIRST_ROW","tableType":"RELATION","tableNum":1,"s3Link":"common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988061.16/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00305-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz","recordEndOffset":379278015,"recordOffset":379242805,"tableOrientation":"HORIZONTAL","lastModified":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 02:11:32 GMT","textBeforeTable":"Narrative features 6 See also 5 References 4 Debatable Whether Great 3 Debatable Whether Conservative 2 Documentaries 1 Narrative features Contents There have been many superb conservative films: searchnavigation From Conservapedia Essay:Greatest Conservative Movies , Jump to:","textAfterTable":"Documentaries Film Year Rating Comments Gross (Domestic) 2016: Obama\u0027s America 2012 PG Documentary by Conservative author Dinesh D\u0027Souza explores the disturbing origins of Barack Hussein Obama, including his inherited philosophy with his drunken father and his inspiration from Communists Frank Marshall Davis and Bill Ayers. $33,349,941 Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed 2008 PG Ben Stein exposes evolutionists\u0027 scientific and education system deceit. $ 7,690,545 The Great Global Warming Swindle 2007 UR Exposing the greatest fraud in the history of science.
