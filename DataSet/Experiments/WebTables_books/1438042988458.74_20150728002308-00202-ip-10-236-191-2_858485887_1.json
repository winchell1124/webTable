They are listed in the order of Anne\u0027s age in each novel. Series[edit] Susan Owen Ford Leslie Moore Miss Cornelia Bryant James Boyd (\u0027Captain Jim\u0027) Gilbert Blythe Anne Shirley/Blythe Characters[edit] This book introduces Susan Baker, the elderly spinster who is the Blythes\u0027 maid-of-all-work. At the end of the book, Owen Ford\u0027s book is published, and Captain Jim dies with a smile on his face after reading his advance copy. Miss Cornelia, thought to be a confirmed spinster, announces that she has decided to marry Marshall Elliott, who may be a Grit but at least is a Presbyterian; she says she could have had him at any time but refused to marry him until he shaved his beard off, which he had refused to do for twenty years until the Grits came into power. Finally, Anne, Gilbert, Jem and their new housekeeper, Susan Baker, move to the old Morgan house in the Glen, later to be named Ingleside. Anne is greatly saddened to leave the House of Dreams, but knows that the little house is outgrown and Gilbert\u0027s work as a doctor requires him to live closer to town. Leslie, abruptly set free by this news, returns home, and considers taking a nursing course to get on with her life.
