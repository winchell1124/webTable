Onc A terrorist attack in San Francisco sends a teen and his friends scurrying for help when they get swept up by the Department of Homeland Security. Once they are released, DHS sees San Francisco as a place where more intrusive security measures can be applied and the protagonist makes a stand. 1/2 a gripping novel of life in a police state, 1/2 a how-to manual for maintaining your rights and sticking to the man in a police state (including appendices regarding internet security and other handy ways of avoiding prying eyes), this feels more like a primer for the young anarchist or privacy advocate than anything else. However, it clips right along, pulling you into the protagonist\u0027s group of friends and then spinning them away from each other. The only group that doesn\u0027t behave believably is the villainous DHS ( at least, I hope they don\u0027t behave believably). Ably told and worth your time, if only to prepare for the upcoming martial state. ...more","review This isn\u0027t a bad book at all.

It is funny at times and the main character is interestingly conflicted. Unfortunately, she is surrounded by two-dimensional caricatures. All the (openly) religious people are bad and too concerned with looking good. All the (openly) \"scientific\" people are perfect, quirky sure but perfect. It may be that this is they way that a teen protagonist would actually view and describe the people around her, but as an adult reader it came off as propaganda instead of fiction. Also, on occasion, it does a poor job of explaining evolution. ...more","review I don\u0027t really know what I think about this book.

It doesn\u0027t glorify war, but it kind of glorifies the southern cause in the Civil War. All the southerners agree that slavery is wrong, but none of them want to do anything about that. Instead, they all want to fight against the north, whom they all agree will win (and should win). It reads like an apology for the south. Being from the south and being easily offended at those who take easy pot-shots at the south, I don\u0027t feel comfortable with this book either. Also, it ends in a weird spot, almost as if a sequel is being set up, but there really is no need for one. And don\u0027t get me started on the author setting up a storyline in the first chapter and never, ever returning to it. That said, it depicts the fatalism, moral compromises, and bloody horror of war very well. There is even a bit of nobility portrayed. All in all, however, I wouldn\u0027t recommend it. ...more","review None","review A young man, obsessed with flying, is tricked by a megalomaniac into a prison, from which the only escape is through the air.

There is an epic, steampunk feel to this book, although it is written in accordance with actual physics (as far as I know). Although the main character never really feels in danger, it is interesting to watch him overcome the obstacles that the plot throws his way. Unfortunately, he is the only character that is truly fleshed out; everyone else develops not at all over the course of the book. The noble remain noble, the vile remain vile. Even our main character mostly just gets older. Eoin Colfer does a much better job of giving Artemis Fowl an inner life, which is odd because Artemis is much more a charicature. I liked the book itself, which was enthralling, but looking back at it, I can\u0027t realy decide why. So, half-hearted praise. Huzzah! ...more","review The book itself is fine, the plot is compelling, and the characters well drawn. It\u0027s just that the premise of the story is absolutely ridiculous.

In the future, abortion isn\u0027t allowed but any child between the ages of 12 and 18 can be unwound. In other words, they can be broken down to their body parts and donated to the needy.

All this plays out while Hutch\u0027s team is trying to get through the playoffs in their tournament, which could lead to them playing at a major league ballpark. This book is completely predictable. Completely. But sometimes good writing overcomes cliches. Although all the characters filled their necessary roles, they were all brought to life by Lupica\u0027s writing. I don\u0027t know that they were three-dimensional, but I cared about them. Every character had an inner life. This was much better than I expected, which is very likely clouding my opinion.

An accident in her family drastically changes her life and has to adjust in order to achieve her dreams. The Indian setting is interesting, but the bad guys are beyond caricature. The heroine is always the reasonable one; it\u0027s the people around her that cause trouble. It\u0027s all a little much. While that may actually reflect the character\u0027s worldview, it is a little tiresome. You\u0027re not really describing cultural obstacles if everyone who is reasonable agrees with you and only mean-spirited losers believe that tradition is important or necessary.

He grows up, braving occasional werewolves, ghouls, ghosts, witches, and, usually worst of all, humans. This is a Neil Gaiman book and therefore I am psychologically unable to dislike it. With that in mind, it is brilliant. This is, basically, a twist on the old fairy tale of the Boy who wasn\u0027t Afraid of Anything. If you grow up amongst the dead, what hold will the fear of dying have on you? Adding to the great premise, it has the best ending of a YA novel I have encountered all year (and, possibly, ever). Just a wonderful book. ...more","review The resourceful protagonist is the best thing about this book. Also the setting.

The author assumes an intelligent audience and excels at showing (not telling). Each new development is accompanied by a racheting up of tension and menace. There is a real sense of a full world and history behind these events, a history that perpetually threatens to crush our heroine. What a good book! In a future North American dystopia called Panem, tributes (teens) are sent from the provinces to the Capital to participate in gladitorial combat, called the Hunger Games. The winner is promised a life of ease and fame, all the losers die in the arena. Our heroine is one of those who go to compete in the Hunger games, sacrificing herself to save a loved one. Her conflict is to decide whether she is willing to sacrifice her self in order to become the victor in the arena. It is hard to guess her choices or where they will lead her. This was a very good book. ...more","review Todd Hewitt is the last boy in Prentisstown.

Todd finds a hole in the noise, down by the river, and this sets in motion events which Todd and his dog running for their lives. This is a powerful, dark book. I wouldn\u0027t recommend it for anyone younger than 15 or so. But it is well worth the time of those prepared to tackle it. It is the first of a series and it promises to just get better. Todd is a troubled (and occasionally troubling) protagonist. The world is well drawn. The characters are well-drawn. The author is unsparing. A tremendous, propulsive, and visceral read. ...more","review Tally Youngblood is a Pretty now, with perfect looks, a perfect body, and happy, pretty thoughts.

But they\u0027re not all pretty, sometimes she gets a bit too bubbly and starts to remember her adventures as an ugly. Realizing what she has lost, Tally will risk anything to regain her mind for herself and for her new friends (especially a boy named Zane). The first book in the series was a little better than okay; the second is a great improvement. Tally is growing as a character and so is everyone else around her. Shay, in particular, is taking an interesting turn. By tapping into the fear of losing one\u0027s sense of self, Westerfeld gives his struggling teens of the future an everyman quality; they may be perfect, but at what cost. It plays into our expectations of (and fantasies about) celebrity culture, but it works really well. I look forward to reading the next one. ...more","review A thirteen-year-old who has been homeschooled on a hippie commune is thrust into a middle school. Naivete ensues.

This book feels like the middle of a longer story. I haven\u0027t decided if that is a good thing or not, yet. What I can tell you is that the protagonist, the antagonists, the love interests, and the obstacles are simplistic to a fault. But it is a sweet little story. Picking it apart feels like kicking a puppy. So, I\u0027ll stop. ...more","review A straight up retelling of the fairy tale \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon,\" this young adult novel features a courageous young heroine, magical pol A straight up retelling of the fairy tale \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon,\" this young adult novel features a courageous young heroine, magical polar bears, trolls, and an awful lot of sewing. I am skeptical that housewivery has been what saved the day in ya novels prior to this, but at least the author gives props to the importance of stay-at-home-mom skills. My only complaint is that some of the novel feels like filler. I can\u0027t decide if that is deliberate (the heroine has to do quite a bit of hurry up and wait) or problems with editing. However, pacing never overwhelms the story. A good girl is never named and eventually gets caught up in the doings of trolls and polar bears as a result. You know going in that good probably triumphs and love probably conquers, but George takes you on a fun ride in the interim. ...more","review Addie lives with her mom in a trailer. Her sisters live with her ex-stepfather. Her grandfather lives on a farm, but she never sees him. Her best frie Addie lives with her mom in a trailer. Her sisters live with her ex-stepfather. Her grandfather lives on a farm, but she never sees him. Her best friends work at the cornor minimart. This book is a year in her life, dealing with a deadbeat mom, a good dad who isn\u0027t her dad, stolen flutes, turkey soup, and cancer. Really, this has sufficient tragedy for 4 novels stuffed into it. But it remains (along with the protagonist) upbeat no matter what. An interesting melodrama for teens. ...more","review Katniss has survived the Hunger Games, but her life is no less perilous when she returns home. She must keep up the pretense that is madly in love wit Katniss has survived the Hunger Games, but her life is no less perilous when she returns home. She must keep up the pretense that is madly in love with Peeta, fight her love for Gale, and pretend to support the government she hates in order to keep her family and friends safe. At the same time, she has become, without her knowledge, the focal point of a rising movement to overthrow the Capitol\u0027s rule. Trying to maintain the safety of the ones she loves will lead Katniss back into danger again. In this series, Collins has found her muse. The writing is taut, the plotting is perversely good, and the characters behave in ways recognizable to regular human beings, in spite of the extremities of the situation. Really, really good stuff. ...more","review Our protagonist finds himself stuck every Wednesday afternoon with a teacher whom he is convinced hates his guts. He lives in the perfect house with a Our protagonist finds himself stuck every Wednesday afternoon with a teacher whom he is convinced hates his guts. He lives in the perfect house with a socially climbing father, a distracted mother, and a sister who is trying to figure out how to rebel. Over the school year, he\u0027ll deal with yellow tights, architecture, cream puffs, scabby rats, camping, the Vietnam War, and Mickey Mantle with humor, bravery, and a sprinkling of curses lifted from Shakespeare. A very funny, very moving book. This is a very good book. I wonder, though, if it isn\u0027t aimed more at adults feeling nostalgic than kids. ...more","review Evie Spooner loves her parents. She also loves the young man who entered her life in Florida. Unfortunately, her new beau brings trouble in his wake. Evie Spooner loves her parents. She also loves the young man who entered her life in Florida. Unfortunately, her new beau brings trouble in his wake. Soon Evie has to choose between what she wants to believe about her parents and what her heart tells her about this young man. Evie is vividly realized and utterly believable. The story is ambiguous from the beginning, with victories small, tragedies devastating, and no clear heroes (including Evie). However, the book never really drew me in. I always felt keenly that I was watching a 1940\u0027s melodrama, not observing folk living in the 1940\u0027s. I think that this is a better book than I am giving it credit for, but while I appreciated the craft and the storytelling, the characters never really drew me in. Also, this movie is fairly frank about sex, which Harlequin levels of euphemism. It is definitely aimed at older teens. ...more","review A fictionalized telling of events surrounding a boy scout trip in Hawaii gone wrong. The scouts are threatened by natural disaster and intergroup stri A fictionalized telling of events surrounding a boy scout trip in Hawaii gone wrong. The scouts are threatened by natural disaster and intergroup strife. But the intergroup rivalry seems tacked on and unnecessary considering the events in question. Ultimately, not that satisfying a story. ...more","review Animals drive the farmer out and start to run the farm in their own way. Can the Idealism of the revolution last, or will some apple-fed corruption cr Animals drive the farmer out and start to run the farm in their own way. Can the Idealism of the revolution last, or will some apple-fed corruption creep into their utopia? The animals are on their own from the beginning with no-one ever really looking out for their best interest. This never seems to stop them from following anyone willing to lead, though. This is a bleak book, but it is strangely not all that despairing. Perhaps because it features one of my favorite last lines. An allegory for the Soviet Union, it is also fable whose moral lies in the ease with which we let others do our thinking for us. Is there a death more tragic in literature than that of Boxer the Horse? I\u0027m going to say no. Powerful, powerful stuff and a quick read to boot. ...more","review The second in the series.

Not as moving as the first or as satisfying, but good enough to keep me going in the series. Our heroes encounter skating cities, frozen oceans, underwater Fagins, and the last green spot in America. Reeve\u0027s devastating future continues to feel real and his characters remain compelling. Worth a read. ...more","review Flavia de Luce is a chemical prodigy, fascinated by poisons, left to wander the vast halls of her family\u0027s mostly empty estate, Buckshaw. With two old Flavia de Luce is a chemical prodigy, fascinated by poisons, left to wander the vast halls of her family\u0027s mostly empty estate, Buckshaw. With two older sisters who hate her, a mother who is dead, and a father who is mostly absent, she has to look after herself. When she sees her father arguing with a strange man in the middle of the night, she wonders what prompted the argument. When she finds the man dead in the cucumber patch the next day, she wonders who killed him (and whether it might have been her father). Flavia has only the help of the family gardener and her trusty bicycle to solve the mystery or it is the gibbet for her father. I fell in love with Flavia\u0027s voice from the first line. Here it is: \"It was as black in the closet as old blood.\" Has there ever been a better first line for a mystery? Flavia is witty, brilliant, and usually in way over her head. Whether it is in dealing with her unctious sisters or trying to outsmart killers, it is always possible to believe that you are reading the thoughts of a precocious 11-year-old. Really a brilliant little mystery; recommended for anyone, 12 or older, who can handle a little peril and a lot of good humor and chemistry. ...more","review T.S.

Spivet is one of a long line of Spivets born in Montana. Unlike his primarily rancher forebears, T.S. has an artistic, inquiring bent. He draws maps and diagrams, beautiful and thought-provoking. As a result, he wins a position at the Smithsonian museum, awarded to him without them realizing that he is only 12 years old. T.S. makes his way to Washington, unsure of the reception he\u0027ll receive and unsure that his parents will truly miss him. What he finds there is, by far, the strangest twist of all. I think I like this book more than I should. It pushed all the right buttons for me (maps, fantastical maps, intrepid heroism, shocking terror, winnebagos). The illustrations are amazing! As a result, I\u0027m kinda giving the scrambled ending a pass. There are at least two stories in this book that don\u0027t really come to an end. Maybe books about adolescents shouldn\u0027t have proper endings... Anyhoo, an auspicious first novel and a true joy (for me) to read. ...more","review A girl grows up in a castle with a wall.

Determined to see over it, she winds up locked in the top of a tree, with nothing to do but grow her hair and no defense but the whips she makes with her braids. Escaping her prison, without the aid of any princes, she struggles to find her place and restore order to her environment. Punzie is smart, strong, honest, foolhardy, confident, and lucky. All the sorts of things that we admire our heroes. Not a particularly deep book, but a very satisfying, light read. ...more","review Frankie Landau-Banks developed over her fifteenth summer and got noticed upon her return to boarding school.

Now she has a cute and powerful senior boyfriend, but every other girl\u0027s dream isn\u0027t enough. Frankie wants to shake things up and shake them up she does. This book is aimed at younger teen girls, Wodehouse fans, wordsmiths, pranksters, anarchists, and the (sorta) proletariat. Funny, angry, and impetuous, Frankie is a likable and believable hero. Even better in a teen novel, no-one comes off as a cardboard cutout. Surprises galore, too. I finished this book in a little bit of a shock, but quickly realized it had a perfect ending. A must read for impressionable girls (and boys). ...more","review Auden was raised in a home with two professor parents and a slacker brother.

She\u0027s been perfect and isolated her whole life, which didn\u0027t prevent her parent\u0027s divorce. She\u0027s graduated and she decides to spend her last summer with her father and his new wife and child. Will the salty air of the beach (or the brooding manager of the bike shop) get Auden out of her shell? It\u0027s an entertaining piece of fluff. Nothing happens that you don\u0027t already know will happen and almost all of it is cliched. But Auden is realistically drawn and, frankly, a character whom I didn\u0027t initially like. I came around, and I suspect you will to, and that is the best thing about this book. ...more"],["notes","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes
