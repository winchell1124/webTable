It felt a bit more dated, a littl Updated April 2013: Third or fourth time I\u0027ve read Brave New World, and I\u0027m taking it down from four stars to three. It felt a bit more dated, a little less relevant, than it has on other reads in the past. There\u0027s a quaintness about it that feels false or overly conservative to me now. Society is portrayed as backwards because there\u0027s no religion, for example. It\u0027s still interesting satire, and visionary in many ways, but there\u0027s a clear \"right\" sort of lifestyle it\u0027s out to contrast that doesn\u0027t always make sense. Original review: If you could have a life of happiness and leisure, you\u0027d want that, right? Maybe not, if the cost was some personal freedom or a loss of depth and meaning in your life, or if you thought you might get bored or too soft and spoiled. But then, what if you wouldn\u0027t even think to worry about that because you\u0027d been genetically and behaviorally conditioned not to? This is what Brave New World tackles. I thought it might be something like a dire vision of the future, a la 1984, but it isn\u0027t the same kind of scary. 1984 was about a horrific world dominated by fear and pain, but BNW goes to the extreme in the other direction, where there\u0027s so much distraction no one cares about anything else. Society is overly docile and unimaginative and copes with even the most minor problems by escaping with ubiquitous drugs. [See an interesting thematic comparison of the two.] Huxley was definitely on to something... But it\u0027s not black and white, either. Where 1984 projects an unambiguously bad possible outcome for everyone, one\u0027s opinion of what exactly is wrong with BNW\u0027s society is debatable. Different readers will find different aspects frightening, offensive, or immoral, but one might also wonder if that society doesn\u0027t at least have a few things going for it. Overall, a really interesting and important read. ...more","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review First read: May 2006.
