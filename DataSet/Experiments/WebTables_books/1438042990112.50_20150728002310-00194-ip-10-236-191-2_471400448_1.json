I lose interest pretty quickly when things start to move slowly Short stories are usually a little easier for me to get through than longer mysteries. I lose interest pretty quickly when things start to move slowly between finding out what happened without knowing what really happened and then finally, at the end, solving the mystery. Fortunately, Arthur Conan Doyle has written seemingly for people with shorter attention spans (or perhaps for serials, where things had to be kept shorter anyways). He has quite a creative mind coming up with many of these cases and I only rarely found myself guessing (or rather, partially guessing) the outcome after learning the initial details. This does not quite match up with the Sherlock Holmes we see in the new series by the BBC and I think I like this Sherlock (in print) a little better. ...more","review This is a very moving, sad book.

Usually this makes me wary because movies are almost always much worse than the books. And in this case, I can\u0027t really say which I prefer--the books are quite a slog to get through sometimes while the t.v. series compacts everything pretty nicely (although sometimes cuts out small details and characterizations I like). The series gave me a better idea of who the main characters were and where they fit into the story line, and I am grateful for that because there are quite a few people and plot lines to keep track of. But Martin\u0027s world is quite interesting and entertaining (if a little too much at times) and I look forward to keeping up with the series (both book and television) over the next few years. ...more","review None","review None","review None","review The language is often beautiful, but the story itself is a bit too drawn out.

I ended up really enjoying learning more about circuses, especially since much of what happens in the book was based on real events happening in circuses throughout the past. I also enjoyed the flashes to the modern day and getting into the mind of a cranky old man. What I did not end up enjoying about this book were the weak characterizations.
