Though I can be impartial to short stories, when I read this for class, I fell in love with it. I think I connect with it most because I have a childhood friend who always seemed to have everything, every opportunity, everything handed to her, and she walked all over her friends, including me, taking every advantage that came her way. So, when I read this story, I couldn\u0027t help but laugh, thinking Mrs. Ansley had the perfect revenge. I have no interest in seeking my own vengeance, but it was almost like just reading the story, and making the connection that I did, was my own little way of finally getting the upper hand. ...more","review None","review None","review None","review I\u0027ve read this three times now, in three different translations.
