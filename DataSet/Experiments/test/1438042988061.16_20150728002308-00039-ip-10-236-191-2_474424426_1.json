This is one of the best fiction books by a new (to me) author I\u0027ve read in a LONG time. I listened to the audio (read by the delightful Evil Wil Wheaton) and this is the first time I\u0027ve ever wanted to just go back to the beginning and listen again. And then maybe again. I\u0027m not a gamer, but there is so much geeky goodness stockpiled in here that I didn\u0027t even care. But I am mad that Wade decided to change the name of his Firefly ship from The Kaylee to The Vonnegut. Sorry dude. NOT a good change. If you\u0027ve ever geeked out about anything - check this one out. Thanksgiving 2012 - Went on a TN to IN to WI to IN to TN roadtrip with the boyfriend and actually got him hooked on this one too! He\u0027s not a reader at all, so I didn\u0027t know if he\u0027d like it, but he\u0027s a big gamer and he was hooked. Do I know my books or what? :) Reread again for Nashville to Florida road trip 2014. Still an awesome book! ...more"],["notes","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!"],["recommender","recommender none","recommender none","recommender none","recommender none","recommender none","recommender none","recommender none","recommender none","recommender none","recommender none"],["comments","comments 0","comments 0","comments 0","comments 0","comments 0","comments 0","comments 0","comments 0","comments 0","comments 0"],["votes","votes 0","votes 0","votes 0","votes 0","votes 0","votes 0","votes 0","votes 0","votes 0","votes 0"],["read count","# times read 1","# times read 1","# times read 1","# times read 1","# times read 1","# times read 1","# times read 1","# times read 1","# times read 1","# times read 1"],["date started","date started not set","date started not set","date started not set","date started not set","date started not set","date started not set","date started not set","date started not set","date started not set","date started Apr 27, 2012"],["date read","date read Jun 2003","date read Dec 2005","date read Jan 2006","date read not set","date read not set","date read not set","date read not set","date read not set","date read not set","date read May 2012"],["date added","date added Sep 04, 2007","date added Sep 07, 2007","date added Sep 07, 2007","date added Aug 14, 2008","date added Aug 14, 2008","date added Aug 14, 2008","date added Aug 14, 2008","date added Aug 14, 2008","date added Aug 14, 2008","date added Apr 27, 2012"],["date purchased","date purchased","date purchased","date purchased","date purchased","date purchased","date purchased","date purchased","date purchased","date purchased","date purchased"],["owned","owned","owned","owned","owned","owned","owned","owned","owned","owned","owned"],["purchase location","purchase location","purchase location","purchase location","purchase location","purchase location","purchase location","purchase location","purchase location","purchase location","purchase location"],["condition","condition","condition","condition","condition","condition","condition","condition","condition","condition","condition"],["format","format Hardcover","format Paperback","format Paperback","format Paperback","format Hardcover","format Hardcover","format Paperback","format Mass Market Paperback","format Hardcover","format Audio CD"],["","actions view (with text)","actions view (with text)","actions view (with text)","actions view (with text)","actions view","actions view","actions view","actions view","actions view","actions view (with text)"]],"pageTitle":"pianogal\u0027s bookshelf: top-ten-all-time-favorites (showing 1-10 of 10) (sorted by: date added)","title":"","url":"http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/333692-pianogal?order\u003da\u0026shelf\u003dtop-ten-all-time-favorites\u0026sort\u003ddate_added\u0026view\u003dreviews","hasHeader":true,"headerPosition":"FIRST_ROW","tableType":"RELATION","tableNum":1,"s3Link":"common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988061.16/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00039-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz","recordEndOffset":474453615,"recordOffset":474424426,"tableOrientation":"HORIZONTAL","textBeforeTable":"close owned review list reading main column sets votes title shelves review recommender read count rating purchase location position owned num ratings num pages notes","textAfterTable":"Loading... 10 of 10 loaded sort Comments Date added Date read Date started Date updated Notes Random Rating Read count Recommender Review Votes asc. desc.
