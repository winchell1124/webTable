It is going to be the worst grossing X-Men film WITHOUT inflation being counted and if we count inflation the picture gets even gloomier. However the word of mouth is positive and a sequel is planned, with the good will from this film in mind the sequel good do better numbers. Lets not forget each of the X-Men movies grew in gross from the last. However looking at the worldwide sales X-Men first class is at $160 million in sales outside of America...THIS IS MORE THAN X-Men \u0026 almost more than Wolvering \u0026 X-Men 2\u0027s ENTIRE RUN Overseas...so X-Men First Class is a HUGE HIT overseas and it looks to topple X-Men 3 meaning it could be the most popular X-Men movie outside of America. (obviously inflation matters but the charts don\u0027t show overseas adjusted figures so lets not think too much bout that) Panda 2 and Hangover 2 almost neck n neck....Panda used to be wayy behind in weekly sales, looks like Panda is showing better legs. Midnight In PAris CONTNUES a Great Run....doubling its total gross through only its 4th week gross alone...it looks to make up its $30 Million budget in America alone. Rest is doing as expected.
