The premise of this book is very good - and I LOVE the Introduction; but he uses the bulk of the book to discuss what I feel to be irrelevant things. I wish he\u0027d have stuck to the premise of the book. That being said, I DO think this book fulfills its intent - to make you question your own beliefs and find fault in his arguments (which he quite literally invites you to do in the introduction.) Anyone whose faith is shaken by this book is not rooted very soundly. Scott Adams asks the questions - a very old man povides the answers. In my opinion, Scott concedes his point of view WAY too easily. I liked the book and I\u0027d recommend it, but it\u0027s not great.

The last 70 pages were nothing less than painful for me to read, as I (by that time) had finally come to the decision that there would be no plot or even the remotest chance of a story-line. There was no entertainment, no education, and extremely little enlightenment (5 one-liners, to be exact). For a book that is billed as being a \"philosophical fable\", that\u0027s precious little. This book is about a 12 year old spoiled brat who has absolutely nothing good to say about anyone or anything. I thought, as I read, that that would change -- it didn\u0027t. Descriptions such as \"fat cow\" and \"pig\" are common-place in describing almost everyone she deals with. I grew weary of that after about the third chapter (and there are about 80 chapters in the book). On the cover you\u0027ll find the words \"New York Times Bestseller\" - as I read those words, I lose faith in whomever had the nerve to like this book to elevate it to such a lofty status. It is deplorable. I\u0027d like to say I\u0027m proud that I finished it, but the only redeeming grace in that is to serve as a warning for others. This book sucked.
