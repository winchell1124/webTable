I actually had to take a break after one of the stories, which kind of caught me off guard (even though I know it\u0027s not meant to be a book about butterflies and rainbows). I could definitely read most of the stories, though, and think to myself, \"I\u0027m sure there\u0027s someone going through that this very minute\" if I didn\u0027t personally relate to it. The only problem I had was the wordiness of some of the stories. There were definitely too many words for some of the pictures that were pretty much self-explanatory.

I haven\u0027t read many graphic novels, so I can\u0027t comment too much on the graphics or anything like that. I only know what I like, so I can say that I felt that it was well-written and not too wordy, and I felt the graphics flowed well with the story. I also felt like the story wasn\u0027t rushed, which is something I\u0027ve noticed with other graphic novels. The only problem I had was that it was sometimes (as I believe another reviewer stated) difficult at times to distinguish one dark-haired male character from another because of a lack of detail in some of the pictures. I definitely feel like this is something that every person should read at least once, regardless of if you\u0027re into graphic novels or not. Living in a democratic nation, I think that sometimes people tend to take for granted things that people of the past have worked so hard for, and I feel this book would be a good reminder of everything we could be giving up and getting ourselves into everytime the phrase \"I\u0027m not into politics\" is said. ...more"],["notes","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes
