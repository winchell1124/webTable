Just the thought of eating of eating it in a box was so funny to me. I grew up on this book. It has a very good moral for a children’s book. The moral I think is don’t judge a book by its cover. It is a great book for children First, when I said I grew up on this book I meant I grew up on this book. My mother and I would read it mostly every night and I always wondered, what does green eggs and ham taste like? Next, don’t judge this book by its cover. Better yet don’t judge it by the first page. This book makes great sense for somebody to try something and fights to not, in the end tries it, likes it, the end. Last Dr Seuss is a great children book writer. There was nothing different about this book than the cat in the hat, foot book etc. He always had made book that speak to the reader. In the end Green eggs and ham was a great book to read and to learn more about what Dr. Seuss wrote. ...more","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review This book is such a great book.

One minute it is a quiet day in Philadelphia the next it is a ghost town. I love how it told what happened, the charters and the setting. Firstly, I loved what happened during this story. The twists, the emotions, the struggles and conquest make great stories and that’s what this book has. How this book told what happened during that terrible was superb and right to the point. Second, the characters were fantastic. Mattie was a very strong young girl to go thru this. Grandfather was a great wise man also Mattie’s mother also was as strong if not more than Mattie. Last, the setting was great. I mean if you live Philadelphia and the book is based in Philadelphia why wouldn’t you like it. I never knew that happened in Philadelphia before i read this book. In my opinion, based on what happened the characters and the setting make this story one of m y favorite books. ...more"],["notes","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes
