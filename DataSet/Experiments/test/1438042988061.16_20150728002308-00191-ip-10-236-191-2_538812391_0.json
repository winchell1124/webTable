He’s also remixed works by diverse artists such as Bibio, Spor, STS9, Bear In Heaven and Bar9, to name a few. Angelides also runs the Ancestor label, which issued his “Hypercolor�? and “Angus Dei�? singles in 2009 to positive reviews from numerous magazines, blogs and tastemakers. Ninja Tune recording artist and film composer Amon Tobin hailed his work as “some of the best production I’ve heard in recent times.�?, 96058\u003dAngelides initially made music to share with friends using a primitive Miracle instructional keyboard, a four-track recorder and a bass guitar. He used a Roland keyboard to record his first formal work, a CD titled “Machines on Task�?, for a school graduation project. After high school, between 1999 and 2005, he wrote two full-length albums that he gave away at small shows. During this time he spent two years working on music in a secluded lakeside house in Connecticut. It was there that he also wrote gentler, melodic material released later under his other production alias, Welder., 96703\u003dDelving into conspiracy theories and moved by the 9/11 attacks, his music took a darker turn. However, by 2005 he grew tired of his remote outpost and emerged to explore new environments and sounds. “The [conspiracies] were separating me from people,�? he says of that period. “I wanted [people] to be motivated to come together and make change, but it had the opposite effect. I realized that music could be a tool to bring people together.�?, 88693\u003dThe Great Mundane- grew up in a southeastern Michigan home where TV was made of cardboard boxes, the tree in the backyard was his best friend and the words “I am bored�? were household blasphemy. Aside from occasional piano lessons, he passed time deep in his own imagination and on spontaneous road trips, a.k.a his mother’s famous mystery van rides, that seem to have provoked his current state of restlessness. Itching to hit the road, The Great Mundane left his hip-hop roots in Michigan to delve into Chicago’s house/techno scene before arriving in the Pacific Northwest. Now based in Portland, Oregon he takes listeners on a journey exploring the complexities and intricacies of his minimalist and innovative approach to beatmaking. He invents fractured, heady instrumentals laced with lush synthesizer work that navigate the terrain of forward thinking hip-hop and electro/house, all while exhibiting genuine emotion and talented production skills. Each arrangement is collaged with friends, found sounds, synthesizers, and samples meticulously programmed to convey what it might feel like to fall in love with a tree, travel through a wormhole, or to never be bored again. His debut LP “When Falls Arrive�? (psymbolic) was released in 2007 exposing him as one of the top underground electronic musicians to keep an ear out for. Since, he has released “The Wires Remixes�? EP (self-released, 2008), a remix of Deru’s “Peanut Butter and Patience�? (Mush, 2009) and his second full length entitled “Humdrum�? (RunRiotRecords, 2010). The Great Mundane’s music is featured on a long list of compilation albums including Portland’s annual “PDX Pop Now�? series. Expect remixes for SPL, Lorn, KiloWatts \u0026 Bluetech as well as his next full length in May 2011 on 1320 Records., 98437\u003dSoon after his remix of Warp’s Bibio was featured in Pitchfork, he was asked by Flying Lotus to perform at the Brainfeeder Sessions in LA alongside Nosaj Thing. Angelides has since joined forces with Amon Tobin in a collaborative music project called “Eskamon�? that highlights their love of field recoding and unique take on sound manipulation. His first single on Warp entitled “Lands and Bones�? featuring Swan is set for an early 2010 release on a split single with good friend EPROM., 117323\u003dLatest newsletter: May 2015, 97644\u003dIn early 2006 he was invited to play in San Francisco. He fell in love with the area’s culture, art, music and landscape and relocated to the city soon after. He was immediately embraced by SF’s frenetic electronic producer and label community., 95345\u003dAngelides�? performance moniker was inspired by San Francisco experimental music icons The Residents�? 1979 album “Eskimo�?. Drawn to the album’s character-based stories and shamanistic themes, he dropped the title’s middle “I�? and launched his Eskmo project in 1999 in his home state Connecticut. Prior to that, in the mid-90s, he was introduced to renegade funk combo Primus and UK breakbeat techno wizards The Prodigy. The music virus soon took hold. He learned to play bass and formed bands while absorbing �?90s electronic music from Aphex Twin, Frankie Bones, 187, Dieselboy, The Chemical Brothers and Moby among others., 125746\u003dCopyright © 2012 KBOO Community Radio | Copyright Policy | Community Guidelines | Website Illustration \u0026 Design by: KMF ILLUSTRATION, 97911\u003dOne track that caught on big in 2009 was the self-released “Hypercolor�?. “I wanted to write a tune at 140 bpm,�? he says of the beaming, colorful song. “I made [the beat] a triplet pattern and added some Tom Waits-y sounds to it. I wanted it to be a really big sounding track without it being an aggro tune.�? The track was featured on the Mary Anne Hobbs�? BBC Radio1 show and was presented by Bleep as one of the top 100 tracks of 2009 in their catalog., 93855\u003dESKMO-Brendan Angelides is a San Francisco based electronic music producer who records and performs live as Eskmo. His multi-genre compositions have been featured on influential labels like Warp Records and Planet Mu (most recently having been signed to the mighty Ninja Tune). While Angelides�? tracks encompass a wide range of electronic styles, he avoids classifications. Bleep.com described his tracks as “Masterfully produced�? sophisticated, post-Dilla hip-hop funk�?. His last single of 2009 entitled “Let Them Sing�? on Mu was met with equal praise and described by sites like Boomkat as “[Putting] Eskmo on his own electronic plateau.”}","lastModified":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 08:02:09 +0000","textBeforeTable":"10/21/2010 Air date:  Dead Flag Blues playlist for 10/21/2010 Login or register to post comments It\u0027s that time of the year when ghosties and ghoulies, witches and warlocks, zombies and princesses will be roaming the streets and demanding treats.
