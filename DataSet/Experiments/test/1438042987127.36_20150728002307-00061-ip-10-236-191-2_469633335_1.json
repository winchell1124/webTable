book t This is set in the same world as, the better known story, Ella Enchanted (if you have only seen the movie then I totally recommend reading that book too). The fairy Lucinda is at it again, giving gifts that no one really wants. But Aza has a gift that\u0027s all her own -- the gift of singing. In the Kingdom of Ayortha Aza is shunned because she is far from the fairest of them all but in the Ontio Castle, the land of the singers, her voice is captivating and the Queen wants it to be hers while the prince finds himself drawn to it. This is the story of self discovery for the young lady Aza who may not be beautiful but her voice can melt the heart of the one she loves. This story was a take on the classic tale of Snow White and I loved what Levine did with it. She and Shannon Hale both do such amazing things with fairy tales. I recommend reading them all. I was a bit disappointed with this one at first because it was soooo different from the classic story but as I continued reading it I couldn\u0027t help but to fall in love with the characters and the story.
