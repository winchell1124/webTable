What does a study on a serial killer have to do with Luna Lovegood? Wel It’s a testament to my love of Luna Lovegood that I bought and read this book. What does a study on a serial killer have to do with Luna Lovegood? Well, as any fan can tell you, the actress who played Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter films is co-starring in a film called “The Monster Butler,�? which is based on the life of this serial killer. She will be playing Fiona Carrick-Smith, the daughter of an aristocrat whose family hires “the monster butler.�? I bought the book because I wanted to learn about Fiona, but as she’s not mentioned in the book at all, I have to conclude that she didn’t exist. The film claims to be “based on the life�? of Archibald Hall, which means parts will be pure fiction. Actually, after reading this book, I wouldn’t be surprised if the film was almost entirely fiction. It all depends on whose version of the story you believe. First, the facts. “The Monster Butler�? was born in Scotland in 1924 as Archibald Hall. As a teenager, he showed violent tendencies and kept a shrine of Nazi paraphernalia in his home. (It would be incorrect to call it memorabilia. The Nazis were actually in power when Hall was a teenager.) He committed a series of thefts that landed him in jail, and there he began having homosexual sex. After his release, he decided to upgrade his thievery by landing butler posts in posh homes and robbing his employers. To do this, he developed a more suave persona and renamed himself Roy Fontaine, the surname taken from actress Joan Fontaine. Eventually, he killed five people and was caught shortly afterward. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and died in 2002. While in prison, Hall/Fontaine wrote two books about his life, A Perfect Gentleman and To Kill and Kill Again. The first part of this book summarizes his account. He describes discovering at a young age that he exuded powerful personal magnetism, resulting in his having many lovers of both sexes. He portrays himself as a clever, sophisticated jewel thief who was able to outwit his victims and the law at every turn. He was even involved in some political intrigue with the Soviets! He paints his first murder as self-defense and then blames the cruel treatment he’d received in jail for turning him into a murderer. The second part of the book pokes holes in the story. A.M. Nicol, the author of the book, is a criminal defense attorney in Scotland, and he does a creditable job of it by comparing police reports to Hall/Fontaine’s various accounts of himself, which are, of course, contradictory in themselves. You don’t have to get too far in this section of the book before you’re convinced that Archibald Hall was a megalomaniac and a liar. He was not anywhere near as suave or as clever as he believed himself to be. After all, he was caught numerous times. This section also includes some of Hall/Fontaine’s own written confessions, and judging by them, he was so illiterate that he had to have worked with a ghost writer on his books. So probably the only one who believed in “Roy Fontaine, master jewel thief�? was Archibald Hall himself. And then we get to the third part, the “Why Did He Do It?�? section. And here is where the book went from 3 to 4 for me. The first chapter of this section, which is all about Hollywood, deserves a 5. Aside from renaming himself after a movie star, Hall/Fontaine copied many plot elements from popular movies of the day into the stories of his escapades, the intrigue with the Soviets being one of them. The book names quite a few of them: “To Catch A Thief�? in which a debonair jewel thief played by Cary Grant ends up with the high society girl, Grace Kelly; “Raffles�? the beloved butler turned thief. Naturally, all this affected me especially strongly because of the massacre in Aurora, CO. Let me quote from the book: “Studies show that a link exists between a reliance on film media for information and the propensity for criminal behavior. The greater the reliance, the greater the possibility. . . It goes without saying that the effect is greatly magnified if there is already some mental imbalance. While that certainly seems to have applied to Fontaine, there are other known examples. John Hinckley was convinced that his attempt to murder President Reagan would impress Jodie Foster and would lead him to having a relationship with the female star of “Taxi Driver.�? American serial killer Joel Rifkin, who murdered seventeen women between 1989 and 1993, was said to be infatuated by Hitchcock’s 1972 film “Frenzy,�? from which he gleaned some practical hints about the mechanics of murder. When eventually arrested, he was found to have Noxzema cream smeared on his moustache to combat the stench of the decaying corpse found in the back of his pick-up truck, an idea imported from the 1991 film “The Silence of the Lambs.�? Undoubtedly, then, Fontaine was neither the first nor the last case of such media-inspired delusions.�? Anyone still with me? Does that not shake you up? I went so far as to write a letter to Dark House Productions today, the film company producing “Monster Butler,�? urging them not to show the film. I fear they’ll be portraying Roy Fontaine, not Archibald Hall. Roy Fontaine, after all, was a Hollywood creation. His story is much more glamorous and dramatic than the sordid truth of Archibald Hall. Then there are the actors to consider. The actor playing Fontaine is Malcolm McDowell, whose most famous role was Alex in “A Clockwork Orange.�? Among the copycat crimes that film inspired was a gang rape so sick and violent that the director himself had the movie removed from the theatres! It wouldn’t surprise me if the guilt stemming from that incident was a major cause of Malcolm McDowell’s own bout with alcoholism. And the victim will be “Luna Lovegood,�? a character probably best loved by female fans who identify with her because we were weird, teased, and lonely. . . easy prey for creepy guys who identify with the sociopathic Alex. I hate to say something to hurt Evanna Lynch’s career, but I hope they cancel the film. I’m afraid it will give Roy Fontaine all the posthumous glory Archibald Hall ever dreamed of. ...more","review Even though I’m a big fan of quality children’s literature, I read this book more out of interest in the author’s life than in the book itself. Janusz Even though I’m a big fan of quality children’s literature, I read this book more out of interest in the author’s life than in the book itself. Janusz Korczak was a Polish Jew who lived through both World Wars. By profession, he was a doctor and educator, but he was also a children’s advocate who appeared in court representing children’s rights. In World War II, he ran an orphanage for Jewish children in the Warsaw ghetto. And at the end, when he was given a chance to flee and save himself, he said, “You do not leave a sick child in the night, and you do not leave children at a time like this.�? He and the children died in Treblinka. The book is the story of Matt, a boy who succeeds to the throne at about five or so. As he grows into the job, he becomes a very respectable leader, enacting all sorts of reforms for children, some of which are very good and some of which are just pure fun. Because of all this, the first half of the book is an action-packed children’s fantasy. My only criticism up until then is that King Matt is very much like Cedric of Little Lord Fauntleroy. He’s so admirable that you can’t help rooting for him as he improves the world around him, but he’s a little too good to be true. Unfortunately, but realistically, things don’t stay good for Matt. In fact, they get quite dark and violent. But since the book was first published in 1923, with World War I only recently over and the tensions of World War II bubbling under the surface, the author probably didn’t think he needed to shelter young readers from violence. They’d already experienced it in reality. Other warnings: first, the Africans in this book are portrayed as somewhat savage, though through the character of the African princess Klu Klu (was the author thinking of the Klan?) the author voices the criticism that European culture is at least if not more barbaric. And final warning, the last line is as vague and unsatisfying as the ending of Stuart Little. In spite of all this, I still recommended the book to my kids. And if they stop in the middle and give Matt a happily ever after, they’ll have given themselves a fun literary treat. If they read the ending, we’ll have a lot to discuss. But children aren’t naïve. They might not be so shocked. As for me, I’m going to check out the author’s Warsaw diaries and perhaps his parenting books. His children’s fiction was a mixed experience, but nobody can deny that he lived and died as a hero. ...more","review This is a typical frum novel, which means it has a worthy moral and a fairly compelling storyline, but it’s not told with great mastery. The story is This is a typical frum novel, which means it has a worthy moral and a fairly compelling storyline, but it’s not told with great mastery. The story is about a machlokes (dispute) amongst the residents of an apartment building in Jerusalem. It begins when an older couple, the Brechers, refuse to sign the papers that would allow the Greenbaums, a couple with eight kids, to expand their apartment. Up until then, the families got along famously, but because of this, the Greenbaums get cold and distant, even though the Brechers are old and sick. Then the neighbors start taking sides. It’s not pretty, but it’s a good moral lesson in the dangers of machlokes and the importance of being dan l’kaf zchus (withholding judgment until you know the facts). Basically, you can view the book in three parts: 1) the events that give rise to the conflict 2) a diary explaining Mrs. Brecher’s past and 3) the resolution. The flaw with part 1 is that it hints at an unknown connection between the Brechers and the Greenbaums, but it’s not in the least bit subtle. That’s not to say that readers are likely to guess the connection, but it’s nothing like Harry Potter (lehavdil), in which small details become the underpinnings of a terrific plot twist. With this book, there’s just that one single hint which gets underscored over and over. I was hooked because I wanted to know the secret, but I would have preferred more subtlety. Part 2, the diary, has a different problem. It’s definitely the most moving part of the book, but it simply doesn’t read like someone’s diary. It’s just a continuation of the novel, except in first person. And then there\u0027s the biggest flaw of all: the entire premise. Though I know only too well that arguments bring out the worst in people, I couldn’t help but think that if the characters hadn’t been so secretive, they could have avoided the whole conflict. Of course, if they had, there wouldn\u0027t have been a novel. So all in all, this was a decent enough read for a Shabbos afternoon, but no great work of literature. ...more","review If you\u0027re like one of the characters in the title story of this collection and you are drawn to Holocaust stories that show the humanity rising within If you\u0027re like one of the characters in the title story of this collection and you are drawn to Holocaust stories that show the humanity rising within the inhumanity, you won\u0027t find it here. There are no dying men passing on their hidden tefillin to the next Jew in the barracks, no Bais Yaakov graduates, burning with typhoid fever, holding each other up through roll call. For that, I recommend Between My Father and the Old Fool and To Vanquish the Dragon. This book is about much more ordinary, much less saintly people. In fact, most of them are terribly flawed and some teeter on the verge of evil. Having said that, it\u0027s a brilliantly-written book that had me riveted, which is why I gave it four stars. All the stories are about Jews post-Holocaust, both actual survivors or just Jews who have grown up in the shadow of its history. The author was raised Orthodox, and the stories do reflect his knowledge of Torah, but he\u0027s no longer Orthodox, so they also reflect quite a bit of cynicism. Almost all the stories have a surprise twist and some have fantasy elements. They\u0027re funny, too, but often that humor is black. The person who loaned me the book recommended the last story in the collection, and it was one of the better ones, but my favorites were \"Sister Hills,\" which takes place in a West Bank settlement town, and \"The Reader,\" the only story without an overtly Jewish theme. I am completely bewildered by the ending of the story called \"Camp Sundown,\" and I wish I\u0027d never read \"Peep Show,\" which begins exactly where you think, but ends in a surreal Woody Allen-esque scene. Nathan Englander may well be the Philip Roth of my generation. He\u0027s an incredibly talented writer. But to keep my hashkafos clean, I think I\u0027ll be avoiding his work from now on. ...more","review This is one of those books whose storyline had me riveted in spite of myself. Not only do I regret having read it, I regretted it while reading it. An This is one of those books whose storyline had me riveted in spite of myself. Not only do I regret having read it, I regretted it while reading it. And yet I stuck with it till the end. Perhaps for that reason, my rating of 2 is not really fair - an addictive story is a sign of good writing - but if you want to keep your mind and soul clean, this is not the book for you. The book is a fantasy/horror love triangle between a naive 18-year-old boy, a practicing witch, and a third character whose identity would spoil the whole plot. It\u0027s also got some meta elements because the narrator is an 82-year-old writer (much like Richard Matheson himself) telling the story of what happened to him when he was 18. Because he is a writer, he frequently inserts critical comments on his word choices in telling the story. Some of these are funny, but sometimes, it just comes across as gimmicky. The best part by far was the very beginning - realistic descriptions of war; the protagonist fought in World War I. But seriously, this is one I should have avoided. The word \"erotic\" in the flap copy was a sure warning sign, but I ignored it because it was Richard Matheson, author of Somewhere in Time.

In t I was in high school the first time I attempted this book, but having seen the movie, I disliked the differences too much to finish the original. In the past few years, though, I’ve become interested in Truman Capote, particularly because of his friendship with Nelle Harper Lee. So when I saw this was the September group read for �?101 Books to Read before You Die,�? I was more than happy to give it a second chance. I’m very glad I did. Holly Golightly is such a compelling character, I read the whole novella in one sitting. The book and movie are different. I was surprised there was no scene at Tiffany’s itself, which was a nice touch in the movie. I was pleasantly surprised that the cat was in the book, and though of course the movie made changes, they got the symbolism right. It was also fun to see how other details from the book were reinterpreted into the movie, the guitar playing, the breed of the cat, and the rain at the end. Of course, the movie left out some major parts, so if you’ve only seen the movie, I recommend the book, but let go of the idea that this is a love story. This is a friendship story. One totally cool minor detail: Sister Kenny is mentioned in the book! I’d never heard about her until I read Polio: An American Story and And They Shall Walk: The Life Story of Sister Elizabeth Kenny, but such a casual mention in popular fiction proves she really was one of the most celebrated women of the 1940’s, which is when the book takes place. Also fascinating was Truman Capote’s reaction to the film. He hated the changes, and he especially hated Audrey Hepburn as Holly. Since he envisioned Marilyn Monroe for the role, I tried envisioning her as I read, but the image of Audrey Hepburn kept taking over, which goes to prove how much she made Holly her own. All in all, this book and its adaptation are a rarity. One diverges from the other, and yet both deserve their status as classics. The thread that runs through both is Holly and her contradictory quests for freedom on one hand and belonging on the other. The book shows it more clearly with Holly’s dislike of zoos and cages, her explanation of why she couldn’t stay with Doc Golightly, and of course, the symbol of the cat. The movie, in using her words about the cat, captured Holly’s spirit, and that’s why we can believe that classy Audrey Hepburn was the “real phony�? Holly Golightly, though it\u0027s harder to imagine her as Lulamae Barnes, whose background was much more similar to Norma Jeane Baker\u0027s. But had Marilyn Monroe played Holly, she would now seem a much more tragic character �? about as tragic as the author who created her. So it’s good Capote didn’t get his way on this one. The movie, like the book, is supposed to end on a note of hope. ...more","review I\u0027ve read numerous books about Jewish assimilation in America, and numerous books about Jews during World War II, especially about those who directly I\u0027ve read numerous books about Jewish assimilation in America, and numerous books about Jews during World War II, especially about those who directly experienced the Holocaust, but never have I read a book about the assimilation and war experiences of British Jews specifically. So for me, this book visited familiar themes in a new setting. The book traces two Jewish families in Liverpool: the Gordons, who are active assimilationists, and the Katzes, frum in the old generation but gradually going astray. It is set between the years 1914 through the 1960\u0027s, so it covers World War I, the rise of Hitler, World War II, a little about Israel, and the promiscuity of the 60\u0027s, the last of which is seen from the vantage point of the third generation - the Gordon/Katz granddaughter. The book is decidedly not frum. Violation of the Sabbath, intermarriage, and taking lovers without marrying them are all in there. It is also pro-feminist; the character you are meant to admire most is the Gordon daughter who volunteered as a nurse in WWI and remained one for the rest of her life, never marrying and living on her own terms. Even still, I am partial to her sister. Though she is often described as \"fragile,\" when we first meet her, she is reading Jane Eyre, so how can I not love her? Certainly both of them are more admirable than their assimilationist brother, though he is a compelling character whose life experiences are good object lessons in why assimilation doesn\u0027t end anti-Semitism. In general, the characterization is excellent in this book, though there is one glaring plot error: a character who died appears alive when she shouldn\u0027t. My favorite insight in the book comes from Diana, the Gordon/Katz granddaughter after the arrest and trial of Adolph Eichmann. With the atrocities of the Holocaust once again in the headlines, she has the insight that my sister and I have also expressed: \"It\u0027s a privilege to be a Jew. We survived.\" I was cheering for Diana character to do teshuva at that point, but no such luck. Perhaps that\u0027s the path of later generations. . . mine, for instance. Frum people will find much to object to in this book, though I think it captures the secular Jewish experience very well. It\u0027s not especially uplifting, but the characters drew me in, so 4 stars for quality, but not necessarily recommended. ...more","review I saw the movie before reading the book, so I was spoiled by the Hollywood ending.

I still prefer Johnny Tremain, but I understand why he feels differently. This book is more action-packed; it\u0027s the story of a blind white boy and an elderly black man stranded together on a Caribbean island in World War II. The first two chapters were a little dull, but as soon as we meet the character of Timothy (the black man), the book picks up. It\u0027s a survival adventure story with lessons about ending racial prejudice. I liked it, but didn\u0027t love it the way my son does.

But while the protagonist is Jewish by ethnicity, he is most definitely not frum. He lives in an orphanage that he hates, but at night, he sneaks out into Harlem and parties at speak-easies. (The book takes place in the Prohibition era.) There are no flaws in the writing in the book, and Dave is certainly a likable character, but if you\u0027re an Orthodox Jewish parent looking for something \"traditional Jewish\" for your kids, this book won\u0027t fit the bill. ...more","review My teenage son called this book “awesome,�? and when he says that about something that isn’t a computer game, I’m instantly intrigued. Now that I’ve re My teenage son called this book “awesome,�? and when he says that about something that isn’t a computer game, I’m instantly intrigued. Now that I’ve read the book, I completely agree with his assessment. It’s a time travel book that’s also a mystery since the story isn’t given to you contiguously. You get a letter dated 1952, a narrative beginning in the 1990’s, and a journal of sorts from World War II. From there you have to piece the whole thing together. Of course, you don’t quite get the whole picture until the very end, and then, just like with the Harry Potter series, when you look back at those earlier scenes, you can’t help but be awed at the author’s brilliance. The hints were there all along and the pieces fit together perfectly! One warning: this book is dark - much darker than Harry Potter, which at least has a strong redemptive message. At all times, the protagonist inhabits a violent world. But he himself is a likable character and his story is riveting. I agree with my son completely. It may not be the stuff of classical literature, but this book is awesome. ...more","review This was my favorite book back in sixth grade, which is high praise, as it was assigned reading.

No M I first learned of Elizabeth Van Lew, the woman on whose life this historical novel is based, from the International Spy Museum in Washington DC. No Mata Hari, she was a genteel Southern lady who was nonetheless an abolitionist and spy for the Union army. One of the stars of her network was her own freed slave, Mary Elizabeth Bowser, who landed the strategic position of cook in the home of Jefferson Davis. Originally, I was hoping to read a biography of Elizabeth Van Lew, not a historical novel, but this one was so highly rated and well reviewed here on Goodreads, I thought it was worth a try. And now I\u0027m upping its average rating just a little higher by adding my own rating of 5. Like with any work historical fiction, I often found myself wondering, \"Did that really happen or did the author make that up?\" So I especially appreciated the author\u0027s note at the end of the book explaining all of that. I am still looking forward to getting hold of Elizabeth Van Lew\u0027s actual diary, which I have ordered on special loan from the library. No doubt, the author took from this, too. One element of the novel that is obviously pure fiction is that the character of Elizabeth Van Lew is supposed to be a ghost telling you the story of her life. The narrative alternates between the Civil War era and the timeless ghostly realm. This fantasy element might annoy some history purists, but the author makes an excellent point with it: the U.S. is still haunted by ghosts of the Civil War. I intend to follow up on this novel with a non-fictional account, but I think it was a great introduction. After all, the novel is such a wonderfully engaging form, even if we can\u0027t know whether it represented Elizabeth Van Lew\u0027s intimate thoughts as they really were. As a northerner, I appreciated the lesson that the south was not monolithic in support of secession. And best of all were the author\u0027s insights into war, prejudice, and privilege. Highly recommended. ...more","review Like most Jews, I\u0027ve read many books on the Holocaust, but this one is something unique.

For one thing, it\u0027s narrated by Death, which makes for some biting black humor, and the author veers from the traditional narrative form just enough to keep the book innovative while maintaining readability. More than that, because the main characters are four Germans and one non-religious Jew, it is very different than the Holocaust books to be found in the Orthodox Jewish world. The Germans are kind and brave - they\u0027re hiding a Jew in their basement, after all - but even though they hate the Nazis, they\u0027re still products of their culture, which means they\u0027re foul-mouthed and in one case, violent. There is no kedusha in this book, so if that bothers you, stay away. If not, it\u0027s a beautiful and literary read. I\u0027ve given this a 5 because it met all my usual criteria for an excellent novel: I was hooked on the story and I cried at the end. But as much as I grew to love Liesel and Hans Huberman, they\u0027re not Irena Sandler and Oscar Schindler. They didn\u0027t really exist.

Armpit is trying to put his life back together. He’s got a legitimate job and he’s enrolled in summer school, taking speech and economics. But when X-Ray shows up and pressures him into a ticket scalping scheme, Armpit, against his better judgment, joins in. Naturally, they have just enough success to want to keep it going until, of course, they run into trouble with the law. Given that both have prior criminal records, the consequences could be severe. The book was every bit as enjoyable as Holes, and its plot twists were about equally unrealistic. My main reason for reading it was that I’d read that Armpit gets to see the lessons from his economics class play out in his real life business with the tickets. I also hoped those lessons would be good for my son. As it turns out, there’s only one good illustration of supply and demand and a mediocre one about indecision. I guess that’s about as much economics as the average teenage reader could take in a novel. The rest is about love interests, pop stars, and a little (unrealistic) intrigue. But Armpit is such a likable protagonist, you can’t help but root for him. I’m glad I read the book and shared it with my son. I hope other boys, especially those whose lives are much closer to Armpit, find him inspiring too. ...more","review None","review My son has become a big fan of this author lately, and since he sometimes lets me read aloud to him, I got to read just enough of this book to intrigu My son has become a big fan of this author lately, and since he sometimes lets me read aloud to him, I got to read just enough of this book to intrigue me.
