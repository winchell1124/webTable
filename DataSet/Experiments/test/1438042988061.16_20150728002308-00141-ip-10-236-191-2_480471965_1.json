The book reads like a movie that you begrudgingly start to watch, all the while questioning whether something substantial is ever going to happen, but inwardly sensing that something frightful is, in fact, about to transpire. I kept turning the pages and it was worth it. I think, though, what I liked the most about this book was Alarcón\u0027s ability to capture the feel and mood of living in the fictional South American country. I lived in Uruguay for some time as a young adult and I think another reviewer described it best when they said that the author was able to convey the almost hallucinatory feel of South America. It felt that way for me, anyway. The book has some fairly unstable but very interesting characters. I recommend it. ...more","review A thinly veiled, pro Palestinian disappointment.

While still retaining the energy of the first two books, it The Beggar King, is the third book in Oliver Pötzsch\u0027s \"A Hangman\u0027s Daughter Tail\" series. While still retaining the energy of the first two books, it lacked plausibility. Granted, this is fiction, and while the settings and much of the background details are historical, much of the language the author used was too contemporary and unbelievable. This was a huge distraction for me. Set in the mid 1600\u0027s, I hardly think anyone would be telling someone to \"shove it\" as one of the principle characters does. Far too many instances of using modern slang were hard to ignore as was the way some of the character\u0027s conducted themselves. Even if the Hangman\u0027s daughter was considered a social outcast, I hardly think that in the mid 1600\u0027s her intimate relationship with Simon, the son of the town doctor, would go unpunished. The book had so many twists and turns that instead of engaging me, I felt overwhelmed. It was as if the author was trying to stuff as much mystery into the book as he could. Overall, this installment was a disappointment. ...more","review I had a difficult time reading this book.

I was drawn to the mystery and potential of a story involving Ambrose Bierce in Mexico and the revolution but I was put off very quickly by the author\u0027s writing time. It was as if he attempted to paint a mythical, ethereal dream filled with allegory but ended up with a boring nightmare. It was confusing at times, especially when midway between a character\u0027s dialog the author dropped you into someone else\u0027s narrative. I finished the book feeling as if I was no closer to understanding the main characters and like I had just wasted my time. The best part of the book was an excellent narrative of a minor character\u0027s dismal marital history, the death of her husband, and her eventual liberation by the Mexican Revolution. Had the writing and story been as interesting as this I would have enjoyed the book. ...more","review This book was very informative. I appreciated the author\u0027s (also a diabetic) writing style.

When I started reading it, I thought it I don\u0027t know why this book caught my interest as I was browsing the Lender\u0027s Library on my Kindle, but it did. When I started reading it, I thought it was a read that was very timely, given that I was in the throws of a very stressful situation and felt, well, quite alone. On a personal level, this was a gentle reminder that God does indeed care and I\u0027m not alone. It\u0027s a theme that is recurring in this book and in that sense, the book worked for me. Why the 2 stars, then? Hmm ... I agree with many of the reviews here. There is a wonderful cast of quirky and entertaining characters, all of whom provided numerous laughs and enjoyment for me. If I could rate the book on that criteria alone, I\u0027d give this book 3.5 or 4 stars but the story and the circumstances these characters found themselves in were improbable, at best. The resolution of their main problem was so far-fetched to the point of being completely unbelievable. I enjoyed reading the book, but it left me unsatisfied and wondering if somehow the author couldn\u0027t have done a better job of conveying his message in a more realistic way, instead of the quirky and rather fantastical way he reaffirmed God\u0027s intervention in the main character\u0027s life. I\u0027d recommend this book to someone looking for a quick and light beach read, especially if you have a Kindle and can read it for free :-) ...more"],["notes","notes Notes are private!","notes
