It is, in turns, infuriating, heart-warm Fully realised and emotionally inescapable, The Book of Negroes brings humanity to the atrocities of history. It is, in turns, infuriating, heart-warming, eye-opening, and inspiring. Hill\u0027s protagonist, the unforgettable Amidata Diallo, brings a precocious wisdom to the horrors she endures and vividly paints the case against slavery from the colours of her life. Meticulously researched, the intersections with history, especially history that defies the present Canadian narrative (that the True North was a bastion of freedom and safety for escaping slaves), brings gravity and momentum to Amidata\u0027s journey, elevating it from an individual struggle to a symbolic one. Whether rubbing elbows with historic abolitionists, fellow \u0027adventurers\u0027 in Sierra Leone, or those simply caught up in the winds of change, Amidata stands for the nameless thousands whose causes were championed by these larger-than-life figures. Samuel Fraunces, Thomas Peters, and John Clarkson are rendered as idiosyncratic humans whose historical legacies make their short-comings all the more lovable. Other characters, suffer for this symbolic weight. Solomon Lindo, although suitably nuanced in himself, is a challenging symbol to a Jewish reader especially insofar as his story concludes with an if-it-walks-like-a-duck-and-quacks-like-a-duck... message. I don\u0027t have enough historical knowledge to challenge Lindo as a symbol of Judaism in the American Colonies and am disappointed beyond words that such a refutation may not be possible. To be clear, Hill\u0027s depiction is no anti-Semitic charictature and goes far beyond Shylock-ish tropes. Lindo is unique among the slave-owners in Amidata\u0027s journey in that he obviously feels temptation that he does not act upon. His transgressions against Amidata are subtle when compared to her more stereotypical previous owner, but are no less heinous when brought to light. There is the ring of truth in his stumbling, imperfect act of contrition and in the lack of closure between him and Amidata. The world of Amidata is rich and clearly drawn. The rhythm of life in Africa, the colonies, Sierra Leone, and London are all recreated in detail. Hill\u0027s narration and voice are musical and plot drives briskly. There is some repetition in the sequence of events and come suspension of disbelief around the number of secondary characters who take terrible risks to aid Amidata but, overall, the integrity of the narrative is strong and the characters are so colourful that much more coincidence could be forgiven. Any novel that sheds such penetrating light on history intentionally obscured deserves a place on honour in literature\u0027s cannon. A novel that does so with such humanity, clarity, and complexity - without resorting to caricature or popular tropes- is an especially rare achievement. The Book of Negroes is the definition of a must-read; informative and provoking of thought and feeling. ...more","review None","review Putting Elliot\u0027s significance as a modernist to one side, I found aspects of his referential style difficult.

I\u0027ve read Conrad and a few other authors of this period but, evidently, not enough to plug into the constant stream of pre-pop-culture cameos. TS\u0027 s talent shines through this difficulty and the phrases are well turned, even if you can\u0027t understand their exact meanings. The experience was not entirely unlike reading Shakespeare which is no bad thing - it can\u0027t be coincidence that the strongest work in this collection is dramatic in nature.

The Stage Manager character plays a sophisticated game with the audience and the subt Surprisingly strong and resonant, despite a slow start in Act I. The Stage Manager character plays a sophisticated game with the audience and the subtext between characters is palpable. As the Stage Manager says in Act I, this story is a time-capsule - a monument to the way life was at the start of the 20th century. It succeeds in that regard and further - as a foreshadow of the absurdist and epic theatre styles to come (OK, Brecht was contemporary to Wilder but his work wouldn\u0027t reach the North American mainstream until later). I don\u0027t know if I agree with the author of the forward who asserts that this is the great American play (as a Canadian, I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m fit to judge). It isn\u0027t pure romanticism of the rural/small town experience - there are shadows of racism and segregation, moments of startling inequality between sexes and the bleak final act undercuts much of the sweetness that precedes it. Mamet\u0027s Glengary Glenross is a more likely candidate (although it gives women shorter shrift)...perhaps Larson\u0027s Rent if you\u0027re musically inclined; However, Our Town\u0027s sense of theatricality, archetypal characters, and timeless conflicts certainly earn it an enduring place in the American canon. ...more","review Borders on Parody AYLI seems to be a mishmash of Shakespeare\u0027s most well-known tropes whose hasty resolution left me rolling my eyes. It is well known Borders on Parody AYLI seems to be a mishmash of Shakespeare\u0027s most well-known tropes whose hasty resolution left me rolling my eyes. It is well known that the Bard, like successful playwrights of any age, pilfered material from other plays, history stories, and then-current events; it is another matter entirely when he seems to be stealing from himself. A young nobleman, Orlando, is denied his inheritance by his grasping brother, Oliver. To prove his worth, Orlando accidentally embarasses the Duke and, simultaneously, wins the heart of Rosalind, niece to the Duke and daughter of (stay with me, here...) the previous Duke who was unjustly deposed and lives in exile. Fearing for his life at home, Orlando quits the city for the rustic forest. Rosalind follows him and assumes a male disguise to instruct Orlando in the proper wooing of a lady. They fall in with the Duke in exile and, amid the romantic entanglements of various hangers-on, come to find better happiness in the barren wilderness than in kingly courts. Without the benefit of research, it seems that the entirety of AYLI is cribbed from other Shakespeare plays. The cross-dressing heroine is given better scope in Twelf Night; the exiled Duke prefigures The Tempest, as does the appearance of a god or spirit to sanctify the wedding in Act V. These elements, and others, suffer for their proximity to each other. There are high points to this text, however. The clown, Touchstone is a breath of air and his plot is the most effective in carrying the rural over urban theme. As always, Shakespeare is a master of wordplay and, even when the plot falls short, the wit and pacing of the text is good fun. Like Twelf Night, AYLI has the character of a raucous party where plot takes a backseat to frolic. The difference lies in the last minute reversals of fortune that occur largely off-stage (the fate of the younger Duke, as in Much Ado About Nothing, is resolved by a new character giving a speech and has no causal link to the action of the play) and are independent of the characters\u0027 actions. AYLI seems like a roast of Shakespeare rather than a proper play as it trots out, one after the other, characters and plots done previously and better. ...more","review A popular novel with substance, range, and glorious, glorious payoff.
