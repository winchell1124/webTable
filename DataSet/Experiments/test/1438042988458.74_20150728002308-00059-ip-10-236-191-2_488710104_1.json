I had heard lots of great things about it and those I know that had read it raved about it. I admit, I was disappointed. It didn\u0027t really hold my attention. Fortunately, it was an easy read and I was able to finish it quickly. Maybe my disappointment is based on the high expectations I had going into reading the book. It wasn\u0027t what I expected.

I thought this one was leaps and bounds better than the first. So many twists and turns and I loved the teasing cliffhanger. Now I MUST read the 3rd book to find out what happens! This book in the series had an easier story line to follow. When people ask me what the first book is about I have a hard time explaining it because it was so muddled for me. This story, however, was great and much easier to follow. The background you get on Lisbeth gives an insight into who she is and why she is the way she is. I wasn\u0027t sure I wanted to read this book because the first one was only mildly interesting. However, I\u0027m so glad that I did. This book gained my attention very early on and kept it throughout the whole book. I can\u0027t wait to read the next one! ...more","review This book was leaps and bounds better than \"Matched\" was.
