On the track, Mayall performs an adapted speech from Shakespeare\u0027s Henry V. In June 2010, the official BBC Match of the Day compilation CD (2010 Edition) was released by Sony/Universal featuring Noble England. After Mayall\u0027s death in 2014, a fan led campaign began to get \"Noble England\" to number 1 during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. It rapidly climbed the official charts in the United Kingdom and broke in at number 7.[32], 43221\u003dOn 5 March 2011, Mayall appeared on Let\u0027s Dance for Comic Relief in which he came on stage and attacked Ade Edmondson with a frying pan during his performance of The Dying Swan ballet.[34] Edmondson mentioned backstage that it was the first time in eight years they had done something like that together and claimed Mayall had left his head with a small bump. It would be the last time the duo performed together in public., 46607\u003dOn 7 May 2014, Mayall made one of his last recorded performances in the form of poetry and voice-overs read on English rock band Magic Eight Ball\u0027s second album \u0027Last Of The Old Romantics\u0027 (released on 10 November 2014)., 13890\u003dEdmondson and Mayall gained their reputation at The Comedy Store, from 1980.[8] Apart from performing in their double act, 20th Century Coyote, Mayall developed solo routines, using characters such as Kevin Turvey and a pompous anarchist poet named Rick.[9] This led to Edmondson and Mayall, along with Comedy Store compere Alexei Sayle and other upcoming comedians, including Nigel Planer, Peter Richardson, French and Saunders, Arnold Brown and Pete Richens, setting up their own comedy club called \"The Comic Strip\" in the Raymond Revuebar, a strip club in Soho.[2] Mayall\u0027s Kevin Turvey character gained a regular slot in A Kick Up the Eighties, first broadcast in 1981. He appeared as \"Rest Home\" Ricky in Richard O\u0027Brien\u0027s Shock Treatment, a sequel to The Rocky Horror Picture Show. He played Dentonvale\u0027s resident attendant as the love interest to Nell Campbell\u0027s Nurse Ansalong., 12026\u003dAfter attending The King\u0027s School, Worcester,where he failed most of his O-levels and scraped through A-levels,[6] Mayall went to the University of Manchester in 1975 to study drama, where he befriended his future comedy partner Ade Edmondson. He never graduated.[7] There he also met Ben Elton, a fellow student, and Lise Mayer, with whom he later co-wrote The Young Ones.[4], 27197\u003dIn 1991, Edmondson and Mayall co-starred in the West End production of Beckett\u0027s Waiting for Godot at the Queen\u0027s Theatre, with Mayall playing Vladimir, Edmondson as Estragon and Christopher Ryan as Lucky.[19] Here they came up with the idea for Bottom, which they said was a cruder cousin to Waiting for Godot.[20] Bottom was commissioned by the BBC and three series were shown between 1991 and 1995. Mayall starred in Bottom as Richard \u0027Richie\u0027 Richard alongside Edmondson\u0027s Eddie Elizabeth Hitler. The series featured slapstick violence taken to new extremes, and gained a strong cult following.[21], 33518\u003dIn 1998, Mayall was involved in a serious quad bike accident. For details see below. The pair wrote the first draft of their feature film Guest House Paradiso while Mayall was still hospitalised. They planned to co-direct, but Edmondson took on the duties himself. Mayall returned to work doing voice-overs. His first post-accident acting job was in the 1998 Jonathan Creek Christmas special, as DI Gideon Pryce, a role he reprised in 2013., 4889\u003dRichard Michael \"Rik\" Mayall (7 March 1958 �? 9 June 2014) was an English comedian, writer, actor and voice-over artist., 20281\u003dMayall continued to work on The Comic Strip films. He returned to stand-up comedy, performing on Saturday Live—a British version of the American Saturday Night Live—first broadcast in 1985. He and Edmondson had a regular section as \"The Dangerous Brothers\", their earlier stage act. In 1985, Mayall debuted another comic creation. He had starred in the final episode of the first series of Blackadder (1983) as \"Mad Gerald\". He returned to play Lord Flashheart in the Blackadder II episode titled \"Bells\". A descendant of this character, Squadron Commander Flashheart, was in the Blackadder Goes Forth episode \"Private Plane\". In the same episode, he was reunited with Edmondson, who played German flying ace Baron von Richthofen the \"Red Baron\", in a scene where he comes to rescue Captain Blackadder from the Germans. Nearly a decade later, Mayall also appeared in Blackadder: Back \u0026 Forth as Robin Hood.[12], 46266\u003dIn October 2013 he appeared in Channel 4 sitcom Man Down, playing the father of the protagonist, Greg Davies �? despite being only ten years older., 22237\u003dIn 1986, Mayall joined Planer, Edmondson and Elton to star as Richie Rich in Filthy Rich \u0026 Catflap, which was billed as a follow-up to The Young Ones. The idea of Filthy Rich and Catflap was a reaction to comments made by Jimmy Tarbuck about The Young Ones. The series\u0027 primary focus was to highlight the \"has been\" status of light entertainment. While Mayall received positive critical reviews, viewing figures were poor and the series was never repeated on the BBC. In later years, release on video, DVD and repeats on UK TV found a following. Mayall suggested that the series did not last because he was uncomfortable acting in an Elton project, when they had been co-writers on The Young Ones.[13] In the same year, Mayall had a number one hit in the UK Singles Chart, when he and his co-stars from The Young Ones teamed with Cliff Richard to record \"Living Doll\" for the inaugural Comic Relief campaign.[14] Mayall played Rick one last time in the Comic Relief stage-show and supported the Comic Relief cause for the rest of his life. 1987 saw Mayall co-star with Edmondson in one episode of the ITV sitcom Hardwicke House, although adverse reaction from press and viewers saw ITV withdrew the series after two episodes, leaving their appearance unbroadcast.[15][16] He appeared on the children\u0027s television series Jackanory. His crazed portrayal of Roald Dahl\u0027s George\u0027s Marvellous Medicine proved memorable.[17] However, the BBC received complaints \"with viewers claiming both story and presentation to be both dangerous and offensive\".[18], 43967\u003dIn April 2011, Mayall again revived the character of Alan B\u0027Stard to make an appearance in a satirical television advertisement for the No2AV campaign prior to the 2011 voting reform referendum in the UK. The character is shown being elected under the alternative vote system, then using his newly gained position of power to renege on his campaign promises. In his personal life, Rik Mayall did not support the alternative vote. In May, Mayall became the eponymous \u0027Bombardier\u0027 in a TV advertising campaign for Bombardier Bitter in the UK.[35] The adverts landed broadcaster UKTV Dave in trouble with Ofcom when they were found to breach the Ofcom code for linking alcohol with sexual attractiveness or success.[36], 16344\u003dMayall\u0027s television appearances as Kevin Turvey warranted a mockumentary based on the character titled Kevin Turvey �? The Man Behind The Green Door, broadcast in 1982. The previous year, he appeared in a bit role in An American Werewolf in London. His stage partnership with Edmondson continued, with them often appearing together as \"The Dangerous Brothers\", hapless daredevils whose hyper-violent antics foreshadowed their characters in Bottom.[10] Channel 4 offered the Comic Strip group six short films, which became The Comic Strip Presents..., debuting on 2 November 1982. The series, which continued sporadically for many years, saw Mayall play a wide variety of roles. It was known for anti-establishment humour and for parodies such as Bad News on Tour, a spoof \"rockumentary\" starring Mayall, Richardson, Edmondson and Planer as a heavy metal band., 48986\u003dMayall twice became involved in politics. In 2002 he dressed as Adolf Hitler for an advert in opposition to Britain joining the euro, and in 2011 appeared in character as Alan B\u0027Stard to oppose the proposal to use an Alternative Vote system in UK elections.[40], 36665\u003dMayall voiced Edwin in the BBC show Shoebox Zoo. In September 2005, he released an \u0027in-character\u0027 semi-fictionalised autobiography titled Bigger than Hitler, Better than Christ (ISBN 0-00-720727-1). At the same time, he starred in a new series for ITV, All About George. In 2006, Mayall reprised the role of Alan B\u0027Stard in the play The New Statesman 2006: Blair B\u0027stard Project, written by Marks and Gran. By this time B\u0027Stard had left the floundering Conservatives and become a Labour MP. In 2007, following a successful two-month run in London\u0027s West End at the Trafalgar Studios, a heavily re-written version toured theatres nationwide, with Marks and Gran constantly updating the script to keep it topical. However, Mayall succumbed to chronic fatigue and flu in May 2007 and withdrew from the show. Alan B\u0027Stard was played by his understudy, Mike Sherman during his hiatus., 55055\u003dMayall\u0027s funeral took place on 19 June 2014 in Dittisham, Devon.[48][49] Among those who attended were Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Peter Richardson, Alan Rickman and Mayall\u0027s Young Ones co-stars Edmondson, Nigel Planer, Alexei Sayle, and Young Ones co-writer Ben Elton. Edmondson also served as a pallbearer.[50], 46082\u003dIn November 2012, Mayall narrated several children\u0027s books on the Me Books app, such as The Getaway and Banana! by children\u0027s illustrator and author Ed Vere., 49860\u003dOn 9 April 1998, Mayall was injured after crashing a quad bike near his home in Devon.[41] Mayall\u0027s daughter Bonnie and her cousin had asked him to take them for a ride on the bike—a Christmas gift from his wife—but he refused because it was raining, and he later went alone.[42] Mayall\u0027s wife Barbara looked out of the window and saw him lying on the ground with the bike.[43] Believing he was joking, she initially left him for a few minutes. Mayall was airlifted to Plymouth\u0027s Derriford Hospital,[41] with two haematomas and a fractured skull.[43] During the following 96 hours, he was kept sedated to prevent movement which could cause pressure on his brain. His family was warned that he could die or have brain damage. He was in a coma for several days.[43] After five days doctors felt it safe to bring Mayall back to consciousness., 39363\u003dMayall provided the voice of the Andrex puppy in the UK TV commercials for Andrex toilet paper, and also had a voice part in the UK Domestos cleaning product adverts. He performed the voice of King Arthur in the children\u0027s television cartoon series, King Arthur\u0027s Disasters, alongside Matt Lucas who plays Merlin. Mayall also had a recurring role in the Channel Five remake of the lighthearted drama series, Minder. He also provided the voice of Cufflingk in the 2005 animated film Valiant.[30], 51740\u003dDuring Mayall\u0027s hospitalisation, The Comic Strip special, Four Men in a Car, was broadcast for the first time. The film involves Mayall\u0027s character being hit by a car.[9] Mayall and Edmondson joked about the event in stage versions of Bottom, Edmondson quipping \"If only I\u0027d fixed those brakes properly,\" and Mayall referring to himself: \"You must know him, that tosser who fell off the quad bike.\"[44] In his 2005 spoof autobiography, Mayall claims that he \"rose from the dead\"., 25228\u003dIn 1987, Mayall played fictional Conservative MP Alan Beresford B\u0027Stard in the sitcom The New Statesman (Yorkshire Television) written by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran. The character was a satirical portrait of Tory MPs in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and early 1990s. The programme ran for four series—incorporating two BBC specials—between 1987�?94 and was successful critically and in the ratings. In a similar vein to his appearance on Jackanory, in 1989 Mayall starred in a series of bit shows for ITV called Grim Tales, in which he narrated Grimm Brothers fairy tales while puppets acted the stories. In the early 1990s, Mayall starred in humorous adverts for Nintendo games and consoles. With money from the ads, he bought his house in London which he called \"Nintendo Towers\".[9], 47731\u003dMayall married Scottish make-up artist Barbara Robbin in 1985, and the couple had three children: Rosie (born 1986), Sidney (born 1988) and Bonnie (born 1995). The couple met in 1981 while filming A Kick Up the Eighties and embarked on a secret affair. At the time, Mayall was in a long-term relationship with Lise Mayer. Upon finding out Robbin was pregnant, Mayall eloped with her to Barbados. Robbin would later suffer a miscarriage. In a 2002 newspaper article, Mayall said that Mayer had since forgiven him.[39], 45122\u003dOn 23 August 2012, the BBC announced that Edmondson and Mayall\u0027s characters of Richie and Eddie would be returning in 2013 in Hooligan\u0027s Island, a television adaptation of their 1997 tour of the same name.[37] However, on 15 October 2012, Edmondson announced during an interview with BBC radio presenter Mark Powlett that the project was cancelled prior to production as he wished to pursue other interests., 37963\u003dMayall was cast as the poltergeist Peeves in Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone (2001), the first of the Harry Potter films, although all of his scenes were cut from the film.[28] He claimed in his semi-autobiographical book Bigger than Hitler, Better than Christ that he had not been made aware that his scenes had been cut until the full film was officially unveiled at the premiere. He told the story of this hiring/firing on his second website blog for his film, Evil Calls: The Raven (2008).[29] For Evil Calls, Mayall\u0027s role as Winston the Butler was shot in 2002, when the film was titled Alone in the Dark. The film was not completed until 2008, and was released under its new Evil Calls title, to distance it from the Alone in the Dark computer game film., 29143\u003dMayall starred alongside Phoebe Cates in Drop Dead Fred (1991) as the eponymous character, a troublesome imaginary friend who reappears from a woman\u0027s childhood. He also appeared in Carry On Columbus (1992) with other alternative comedians. Mayall also provided the voice of the character Froglip, the leader of the goblins, in the 1992 animated film adaption of the 1872 children\u0027s tale The Princess and the Goblin by George MacDonald. In 1993, he appeared in Rik Mayall Presents, six individual comedy dramas (Micky Love / Briefest Encounter / Dancing Queen / The Big One / Dirty Old Town / Clair de Lune). Mayall\u0027s performances won him a Best Comedy Performer award at that year\u0027s British Comedy Awards, and a second series of three was broadcast in early 1995. He provided the voice for Little Sod in Simon Brett\u0027s How to Be a Little Sod, written in 1991 and adapted as ten consecutive episodes broadcast by the BBC in 1995. In the early 1990s, he auditioned for the roles of Banzai, Zazu and Timon in The Lion King (1994); he was asked to audition by lyricist Tim Rice, but the role of Zazu finally went to Rowan Atkinson., 40347\u003dIn September 2009, Mayall played a supporting role in the British television programme Midsomer Murders—shown on ITV1 and made by Meridian Broadcasting—as David Roper, a recovering party animal and tenuous friend of the families in and around Chettham Park House., 45809\u003dIn September 2012, Mayall starred in The Last Hurrah, a six-episode, full-cast audio series that he also co-wrote with Craig Green and Dominic Vince.[38], 17945\u003dAt the time The Comic Strip Presents... was negotiated, the BBC took an interest in The Young Ones, a sitcom written by Mayall and then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, in the same anarchic vein as Comic Strip. Ben Elton joined the writers. The series was commissioned and first broadcast in 1982, shortly before Comic Strip. Mayall played Rick, a pompous sociology student and Cliff Richard devotee. Despite the sitcom format, Mayall maintained his double-act with Edmondson, who starred as violent punk Vyvyan. Nigel Planer (as hippie Neil) and Christopher Ryan (as \"Mike the cool person\") also starred, with additional material written and performed by Alexei Sayle., 46840\u003dMayall\u0027s final TV appearance was in the first episode of the second series of Crackanory which was broadcast on 24 September 2014 on Dave., 34463\u003dIn 2000, Mayall lent his voice to the PlayStation and Windows PC video game Hogs of War. Also that year, Mayall appeared in the video production of Jesus Christ Superstar as King Herod. He joked in the \"making of\" documentary, which was included on the DVD release, that \"the real reason why millions of people want to come and see this is because I\u0027m in it! Me and Jesus!\" In 2001 Mayall acted as Lt Daniel Blaney in the episode \"The White Knight Stratagem\" from the series \"Murder Rooms: The Mysteries of the Real Sherlock Holmes.\" In 2002, Mayall teamed up with Marks and Gran once more when he starred as Professor Adonis Cnut in the ITV sitcom, Believe Nothing. However, the sitcom failed to repeat the success of The New Statesman and lasted for only one series., 54425\u003dOn 12 June the West London Coroner\u0027s Office found that post-mortem examinations on Mayall had proved inconclusive and that further tests would be needed. A full public confirmation of the cause of death has yet to be announced, although Mayall\u0027s wife has stated that he died of an \"acute cardiac event\" after a morning run.[47], 28507\u003dIn 1993, following the second series, Mayall and Edmondson decided to take a stage-show version of the series on a national tour, Bottom: Live. It was a commercial success, filling large venues. Four additional stage shows were embarked upon in 1995, 1997, 2001 and 2003, each meeting with great success. The violent nature of these shows saw both Edmondson and Mayall ending up in hospital at various points. A film version, Guest House Paradiso, was released in 1999. A fourth TV series was also written, but not commissioned by the BBC., 19141\u003dThe first series was successful and a second was screened in 1984. The show owed a comic debt to Spike Milligan, but Milligan was disapproving of Mayall. Milligan once wrote: \"Rik Mayall is putrid �? absolutely vile. He thinks nose-picking is funny and farting and all that. He is the arsehole of British comedy.\"[11] In 1986, Mayall played the Detective in the video of \"Peter Gunn\" by Art of Noise featuring Duane Eddy., 52864\u003dOn 9 June 2014, Mayall died at his home in Barnes, London, at the age of 56. After being called to the house with a report of a sudden death at 13:19, the Metropolitan Police said that the death was not believed to be suspicious.[45] His death was announced by his management team. Tributes were paid by comedy producer John Lloyd, comedian David Walliams, actor and writer Stephen Fry, surrealist and actor Noel Fielding, film director Edgar Wright, and many others.[45], 42523\u003dIn September 2010, an audio book, narrated by Mayall, Cutey and the Sofaguard was released by Digital Download. The book was written by Chris Wade and released by Wisdom Twins Books. In this same month, Mayall played the voice of Roy\u0027s Dad and recorded five episodes of animation[33] In November, Mayall provided narrative for five different characters for CDs accompanying children\u0027s books published by Clickety Books. The books aid speech and language development by bombarding the child with troublesome sound targets. He recorded introductions and narratives for the titles., 31189\u003dIn 1995, Mayall featured in a production of the play Cell Mates alongside Stephen Fry. Not long into the run, Fry had a nervous breakdown and fled to Belgium, where he remained for several days, and the play closed early.[22] In 2007, Mayall said of the incident: \"You don\u0027t leave the trenches ... selfishness is one thing, being a cunt is another. I mustn\u0027t start that war again.\"[23] Edmondson poked fun at the event during their stage tours. In Bottom Live: The Big Number Two Tour, after Mayall gave mocking gestures to the audience and insulted their town in a silly voice, Edmondson said, \"Have you finished yet? It\u0027s just I\u0027m beginning to understand why Stephen Fry fucked off.\" In Bottom Live 2003: Weapons Grade Y-Fronts Tour, after Richie accidentally fondles Eddie, he replies, \"I see why Stephen Fry left that play.\" Towards the end of the Cell Mates run, Mayall revealed a replica gun�? a prop from the play—to a passer-by in the street. Mayall was cautioned over the incident and later conceded that this was \"incredibly stupid, even by my standards\".[24] From 1999, Mayall was the voice of the black-headed seagull Kehaar, in the first and second series of the animated television programme, Watership Down. In the late 1990s Mayall was featured in a number of adverts for Virgin Trains.[25]}","lastModified":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 07:33:13 GMT","textBeforeTable":"Television[edit] Filmography[edit] 2014, as a tribute to Mayall, an unofficial blue plaque appeared in Hammersmith, London, which referenced the opening title sequence of BBC sitcom series Bottom.[56][57][58] At the same time, an online petition was launched in an effort to persuade Hammersmith \u0026 Fulham Council to install a memorial bench on Hammersmith Broadway.[59] On 14 November 2014, a memorial bench for Mayall was unveiled on the same spot where the bench from Bottom used to be before its removal. 2014, on his death, The Guardian described Mayall as an actor whose \"onscreen performances were so full of life. His characters weren\u0027t neatly drawn sketches: they were vast mad scribbles, jammed to the margins with noise and energy\". Commenting of his role in the sitcom Blackadder, it noted, \"Upstaging an entire fleet of world-class comedians should have been impossible.
