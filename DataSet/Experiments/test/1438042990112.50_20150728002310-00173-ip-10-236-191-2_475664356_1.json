Definitely calling it quits with this series.","review As happy as I was that the Mortal Instruments series was continuing... I would\u0027ve preferred that it hadn\u0027t. Because this book? Was painful. I am usual As happy as I was that the Mortal Instruments series was continuing... I would\u0027ve preferred that it hadn\u0027t. Because this book? Was painful. I am usually able to finish books quickly but this one drug on and on and on to the point where I just wanted to give up. Some spoilers ahead. I had a hard time from the very beginning understanding exactly what was going on. There wasn\u0027t a clear plot and even if the author was attempting to be vague and have it be a surprise or whatnot, she failed miserably. The basis of the book solely revolved around Jace and Clary\u0027s relationship problems, but even those weren\u0027t clear. And it was beyond irritating that Jace was clearly having issues and yet he refused to talk to Clary about it. And him continuing to say \u0027I love you but I can\u0027t be with you, but lets kiss and make out but... now I can\u0027t look at you. Get away from me.\u0027 That repeated about 5 times kinda made me want to rip his face off. And then the ending?! Come on. Yeah, we\u0027re going to leave Jace up on the roof alone with the kind of not so dead guy but everything\u0027s going to be fine because obviously things went perfect the FIRST time they killed him. Stupid. It was like a bad horror movie where the dumb blonde decides to go down to see what the chainsaw-like noise is in the dark basement even though the light won\u0027t turn on and she can\u0027t be bothered to find a flashlight. I loved the first three of the Mortal Instruments but was seriously disappointed in this one. The series would\u0027ve been better off left as it was in the third book. ...more","review *sigh* Another Sookie book. :) Was so excited to get my hands on this one the day it was published!

This story begins with Sookie being at Merlotte\u0027s when it gets firebombed. Suspicion automatically falls on the so-called \u0027anti-shifters\u0027 since Sam has recently gone public as a shifter. More attacks occur; however, its realized that the attacks seem to be focused on Sookie rather than Sam. Sookie is also involved in the situation with Eric trying to kill his current \u0027master\u0027. As usual, Sookie\u0027s got some serious shit to deal with. And as much as I loved having another Sookie book to read, it was just okay. I was disappointed with the revelation between her and Eric and what he\u0027d been keeping from her (because I love Eric-will be very disappointed if her and Bill end up back together *blegh*) and Charlaine Harris\u0027s quirky statements were oftentimes cringe-worthy. The one that comes immediately to mind is Sookie\u0027s need of an ice pack after sex with Eric. I mean REALLY? Come on. Being the loyal fan I am, I will still be waiting anxiously for the next one. ...more","review This book really surprised me.

I had to keep reading. This book was such a refreshing change from the typical books written today. It\u0027s based on a 1984 type society where a girl and a boy is selected each year from each \"District\" to compete in The Hunger Games: a battle to see who is the last to survive.
