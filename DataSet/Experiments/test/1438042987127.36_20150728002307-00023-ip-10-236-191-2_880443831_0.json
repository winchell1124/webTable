Produced by T-Bone Burnett and featuring the gifted multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion on guitars and keyboards, Braver Newer World places Gilmore\u0027s characteristically spiritual lyrics in vivid musical settings that complement but never obscure his singular worldview and magnificent high lonesome voice. The glorious title track, one of the most achingly beautiful songs of its time, is only the first of many highlights; the resigned \"Headed for a Fall\" and the uplifting \"Come Fly Away\" are nearly as brilliant, and a quirky but successful reimagination of Blind Lemon Jefferson\u0027s blues standard \"Black Snake Moan\" is one of the most musically daring tracks of Gilmore\u0027s career. Pure country traditionalists may blanch, but Gilmore\u0027s never been one to do the expected at any point in his","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0}
