He performed on live television anthology programs, as well as on radio, and then returned to Hollywood in 1951 for a role in a Fritz Lang film, Rancho Notorious.[15], 42122\u003dIn the Grossman book, Jack Larson was quoted as having accepted that it was suicide. Although he suggested in a 1982 Entertainment Tonight/This Weekend interview that he had momentarily questioned the verdict based on a friend\u0027s comment, he has stated publicly on several occasions that he always believed that Reeves had killed himself and that quotations implying that he ever believed otherwise were either in error or falsified. \"Jack and I never really tried to get anyone to re-open George\u0027s death,\" Noel Neill said. \"I am not aware of anyone who wanted George dead. I never said I thought George was murdered. I just don\u0027t know what happened. All I know is that George always seemed happy to me, and I saw him two days before he died and he was still happy then.\"[citation needed], 17452\u003dIn 1953, Reeves played a minor character, Sergeant Maylon Stark, in the motion picture From Here To Eternity. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and gave Reeves a second motion picture appearance in a film that ultimately won the Oscar (the other being Gone With The Wind)., 38467\u003dMany people have refused to believe that George Reeves would kill himself and have pointed out that no gunpowder from the gun\u0027s discharge was found on the actor\u0027s skin, leading them to believe that the weapon would therefore have to have been held several inches away from his head when it was fired; however, forensic professionals say that gunpowder tattooing is left only when the weapon is not in contact with the skin, while Reeves\u0027 skull fracture pattern shows that it was a contact wound.[32] Followers of the case also point to the absence of fingerprints on the gun and of gunshot-residue testing on the actor\u0027s hands as evidence in support of one theory or another. Police, however, found the gun too thickly coated in oil to hold fingerprints, and gunshot-residue testing was not commonly performed by the Los Angeles Police Department in 1959.[33], 26307\u003dBy mid-1959, contracts were signed, costumes refitted, and new teleplay writers assigned. Noel Neill was quoted as saying that the cast of Superman was ready to do a new series of the still-popular show.[20], 12143\u003dReeves\u0027 film career began in 1939 when he was cast as Stuart Tarleton (incorrectly listed in the film\u0027s credits as Brent Tarleton), one of Scarlett O\u0027Hara\u0027s suitors in Gone with the Wind. It was a minor role, but Fred Crane and he, both in brightly dyed red hair as \"the Tarleton Twins\", were in the film\u0027s opening scenes. Reeves was contracted to Warner Brothers soon after being cast. Warner changed his professional name to \"George Reeves\".[12] His Gone with the Wind screen credit reflects the change. Between the start of Gone With the Wind production and its release 12 months later, several films on his Warner contract were made and released, making Gone With the Wind his first film role, but his fifth film release., 10840\u003dWhile studying acting at the Pasadena Playhouse, Reeves met his future wife, Ellanora Needles. They married on September 22, 1940, in San Gabriel, California, at the Church of Our Savior. They had no children and divorced 10 years later., 9080\u003dIn 1927, Frank Bessolo adopted George as his own son, and the boy took on his stepfather\u0027s last name, becoming George Bessolo.[12] The Bessolo marriage lasted 15 years, ending in divorce, with the couple separating while Reeves was away visiting relatives. When he returned, his mother told him his stepfather had committed suicide. According to biographer Jim Beaver, Reeves did not know for several years that Bessolo was still alive., 32445\u003dAccording to the Los Angeles Police Department report, between approximately 1:30 and 2:00 a.m. on June 16, 1959, George Reeves died of a gunshot wound to his head in the upstairs bedroom at his home in Benedict Canyon. The police arrived within the hour. Present in the house at the time of the incident were Leonore Lemmon (who had been Reeves\u0027 fiancee at the time), William Bliss, writer Richard Condon, and Carol Van Ronkel, who lived a few blocks away with her husband, screenwriter Rip Van Ronkel., 20425\u003dReeves\u0027 career as Superman had begun with Superman and the Mole Men, a film intended both as a B-picture and as the pilot for the TV series. Immediately after completing it, Reeves and the crew began production of the first season\u0027s episodes, all shot over 13 weeks in the summer of 1951. The series went on the air the following year, and Reeves was amazed at becoming a national celebrity. In 1952, the struggling ABC Network purchased the show for national broadcast, which gave him greater visibility., 15115\u003dReeves was drafted into the U.S. Army in early 1943.[14] He was assigned to the U.S. Army Air Forces and performed in the USAAF\u0027s Broadway show Winged Victory. The long Broadway run was followed by a national tour and a movie version. Reeves was then transferred to the Army Air Forces\u0027 First Motion Picture Unit, where he made training films., 44723\u003dToni Mannix suffered from Alzheimer\u0027s disease for years and died in 1983. In 1999, following the resurrection of the Reeves case by TV shows Unsolved Mysteries and Mysteries and Scandals, Los Angeles publicist Edward Lozzi claimed that Toni Mannix had confessed to a Catholic priest in Lozzi\u0027s presence that she was responsible for having George Reeves killed. Lozzi made the claim on TV tabloid shows, including Extra, Inside Edition, and Court TV. In the wake of Hollywoodland\u0027s publicity in 2006, Mr. Lozzi repeated his story to the tabloid The Globe and to the LA Times, where the statement was disputed by Jack Larson. Larson stated that facts he knew from his close friendship with Toni Mannix precluded Lozzi\u0027s story from being true. According to Lozzi, he lived with and then visited the elderly Mannix from 1979 to 1982 and on at least a half-dozen occasions he called a priest when Mrs. Mannix feared death and wanted to confess her sins. Mannix suffered from Alzheimer\u0027s disease and senile dementia, but Lozzi insists that her \"confession\" was made during a period of lucidity in Mannix\u0027s home before she was moved from her house to a hospital. Mannix lived in a hospital suite for the last several years of her life, having donated a large portion of her estate a priori to the hospital in exchange for perpetual care. Lozzi also told of Tuesday night prayer sessions that Toni Mannix conducted with him and others at an altar shrine to George Reeves that she had built in her home. Lozzi stated, \"During these prayer sessions she prayed loudly and trance-like to Reeves and God, and without confessing yet, asked them for forgiveness.\" Lozzi\u0027s claim, however, is unsupported by independent evidence.[citation needed], 4317\u003dGeorge Reeves (January 5, 1914 �? June 16, 1959) was an American actor known for his role as Superman in the 1950s television program Adventures of Superman.[1][2], 23779\u003dWith Toni Mannix, Reeves worked tirelessly to raise money to fight myasthenia gravis. He served as national chairman for the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation in 1955. During the second season, Reeves appeared in a short film for the Treasury Department, Stamp Day for Superman, in which he caught the villains and told children why they should invest in government savings stamps., 37557\u003dReeves is interred at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in Altadena, California. In 1985, he was posthumously named one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company\u0027s 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great. For his contributions to the TV industry, he was awarded a star on Hollywood\u0027s Walk of Fame in 1960.[31], 8589\u003dLater, Reeves\u0027 mother moved to California to stay with her sister. There, she met and married Frank Bessolo, while Reeves\u0027 father married Helen Schultz in 1925. Reeves reportedly never saw his father again.[citation needed], 7572\u003dReeves was born George Keefer Brewer on January 5, 1914, in Woolstock, Iowa, the son of Don Brewer and Helen Lescher.[7][8][9] Reeves was born five months into their marriage[10] and the couple separated soon after Reeves\u0027 birth. At this time, Reeves and his mother moved from Iowa to her home of Galesburg, Illinois.[11], 27956\u003dReeves, Noel Neill, Natividad Vacío, Gene LeBell, and a trio of musicians toured with a public appearance show from 1957 onward. The first half of the show was a Superman sketch in which Reeves and Neill performed with LeBell as a villain called \"Mr. Kryptonite\" who captured Lois Lane. Kent then rushed offstage to return as Superman, who came to the rescue and fought with the bad guy. The second half of the show was Reeves out of costume and as himself, singing and accompanying himself on the guitar. Vacio and Neill accompanied him in duets.[23], 26634\u003dAttempting to showcase his versatility, Reeves sang on the Tony Bennett show in August 1956.[21] He appeared as Superman on I Love Lucy (Episode #165, Lucy Meets Superman\") in 1956. Character actor Ben Welden had acted with Reeves in the Warner Bros. days and frequently guest-starred on Superman. He said, \"After the I Love Lucy show, Superman was no longer a challenge to him.... I know he enjoyed the role, but he used to say, \u0027Here I am, wasting my life.\u0027\"[22] His good friend Bill Walsh, a producer at Disney Studios, gave Reeves a prominent role in Westward Ho, the Wagons! (1956), in which Reeves wore a beard and mustache. It was to be his final feature film appearance., 28818\u003dReeves and Toni Mannix split in 1958 and Reeves announced his engagement to society playgirl Leonore Lemmon. Reeves was apparently scheduled to marry Lemmon on June 19, and then spend their honeymoon in Tijuana. He complained to friends, columnists, and his mother of his financial problems. The planned revival of Superman was apparently a small lifeline. Reeves had also hoped to direct a low-budget science-fiction film written by a friend from his Pasadena Playhouse days, and he had discussed the project with his first Lois Lane, Phyllis Coates, the previous year.[24] However, Reeves and his partner failed to find financing and the film was never made. Another Superman stage show was scheduled for July[25] with a planned stage tour of Australia. Reeves had options for making a living, but those options apparently all involved playing Superman again - a role he was not eager to reprise at age 45., 19442\u003dIn June 1951, Reeves was offered the role of Superman in a new television series[16] titled Adventures of Superman. He was initially reluctant to take the role because, like many actors of his time, he considered television unimportant and believed few would see his work. The half-hour films were shot on tight schedules; at least two shows were made every six days. According to commentaries on the Adventures of Superman DVD sets, multiple scripts would be filmed simultaneously to take advantage of the standing sets, so that, e.g., all the \"Perry White\u0027s office\" scenes for three or four episodes would be shot the same day and the various \"apartment\" scenes would be done consecutively., 25684\u003dIn 1957, the producers considered a theatrical film, Superman and the Secret Planet. A script was commissioned from David Chantler, who had written many of the TV scripts. In 1959, however, negotiations began for a renewal of the series, with 26 episodes scheduled to go into production. (John Hamilton, who had played Perry White, died in 1958, so the former film-serial Perry White Pierre Watkin was to replace him.)}","lastModified":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 01:56:28 GMT","textBeforeTable":"Partial filmography[edit] Toni Mannix suffered from Alzheimer\u0027s disease for years and died in 1983.
