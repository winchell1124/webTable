My would I have loved to get my hands on them just so I could convince them of their self worth :) The book itself actually got on my nerves a little.

In reality they had no more clue than the rest of us and I am almost embarrassed to have thought they were so cool. I felt Dorian\u0027s character was under developed. He looked like an angel and was a bad dude who corrupted everything he touched. I thought the ending was the best part- a little more fast paced- and would have actually given the book four stars if the whole thing was more like it.

So, obviously, it was interesting enough to maintain my interest- it isn\u0027t as though I don\u0027t have a huge stack of other books waiting to be read. (Add .5 star for holding interest.) I had a hard time with how the boy\u0027s parents spoke to him. I know that they loved him and were bound to become frustrated at times, but the F word appeared frequently as the boy was being yelled at. I also didn\u0027t like how some strangers acted towards him...those parts of the book I could have done without. As a warning to my friends, the F word does appear a lot and it always comes off as being kind of harsh within context. (Another star bites the dust...)

Having said that, I wouldn\u0027t recommend this b I finished this book last night and found that this morning I am still thinking about it- in a good way. Having said that, I wouldn\u0027t recommend this book to some of my friends due to the language and a few love scences that might offend. The Tea Rose starts out by taking the reader to the east side of London in White Chapel, home of the murders by Jack the Ripper, who is terrorizing the streets when the book begins. The heroine of the novel, Fiona Finnegan, is your typical historical fiction leading lady: she\u0027s beautful, determined, ahead of her time when it comes to womens\u0027 roles in society, fearless and overcomes every obstacle put before her. Although she is rather stereotypical I enjoyed her character for the most part and my heart broke for her during different parts of the book. Through a course of events she loses almost all of her family, her home, the love of her life and is forced to flee to America where she starts a new life with the goal to avenge her Father\u0027s death. Ultimately this is a book about love and revenge. Overall I enjoyed this book very much even if it was a little far fetched at times and may have been a little overboard for the time period. Despite these things, I really did like it and plan on reading the next book in the trilogy, The Winter Rose. ...more","review This was the sequel to The Tea Rose.

I have to say that I did not like Fiona as much in this book but thankfully the focus isn\u0027t on her as much as other family members. I really enjoy the author\u0027s style of writing and the story line but there was a lot of bad language when it came to a few of the \"bad guy\" characters. There was also some sexual content that I could have done without(particularly when it came to one of the bad guys.) I plan on reading A Northern Light which is a YA book that Donnelly wrote-hopefully it will be the same style of writing but a little less mature :) ...more","review I keep going back and forth between 4.75 and 5 stars.

This was a great book that reminded me a little of a mix between Katherine and Pope Joan. It takes place during the 13th century in England and Wales. Joanna, the illegitimate, 14 year old daughter of King John marries Llewlyn, the Prince of Wales, in an effort towards a peace treaty between the two countries. As she learns to love Llewlyn, Joanna is caught between her father and husband as they battle for the land of Wales. One of the few complaints I had with this book is that there were a lot of characters and they all have foreign names that are hard to keep straight. I had a hard time in the beginning keeping up with who everyone was. It remained slightly confusing through out the entire book as everyone was constantly switching sides and joining different alliances. Overall I thought this was an excellent book. I learned a lot about Wales and am interested in learning more. And of course- I can\u0027t forget my disclaimer for my friends: There are some love scenes and a little language that went with the time period. But it doesn\u0027t have anything on The Bronze Horseman...safe to recommend to a lot more people. ;) ...more","review 4.5 Stars.

I love Penman\u0027s style of writing and plan on eventually reading all of her books. I was reading this and no. 2 in the Outlander series at the same time and Falls the Shadow definitely has more of a historical feel about it compared to Gabaldon\u0027s style which is heavier on the fiction and romance. Falls the Shadow is the sequel to Here Be Dragons, which happens to be one of my favorite books. Where Dragons dealt more with Wales, Shadow still incorporated the Welsh into the storyline but there was more emphasis on the English drama between King Henry III and Simon de Montfort. I look forward to reading the third and final book of the series where the emphasis returns to the Welsh side of things. My one complaint- although I wouldn\u0027t go so far as to call it a complaint- is that the author refers to so many people. It makes for endless amounts of people who you are trying to keep straight which was the same problem I had with the first book. The positive aspect of this is at least there were a lot fewer of the Welsh names which were more difficult for me to keep straight last time. ...more","review This trilogy is a favorite of mine.

I think The Reckoning was my favorite, but it is a close call with Here Be Dragons (the first in the series.) I would highly recommend to anyone interested in midevil England. I am brain dead due to sleepless nights and do not have anything intelligent to say other that these are fantastic books! The one thing I would say to my friends is that Penman relies heavily on the historical side of things in her writing and so I could see some of you finding that the pace might not be quick enough for you to LOVE but they really are interesting stories! ...more","review If you are a Du Maurier fan then this author is another one to check out.

I did, however, feel that there was a little too much emphasis on the gruesome details of the murder/rape, along with all the sexual deviants that kept popping up throughout the story. It was a little over the top for my taste. I probably would have rated this higher if not for those things. Not a book I would recommend to my more conservative mystery reading friends. ...more","review (Possibly 3.75 stars?)
