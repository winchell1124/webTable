While the plot was predictable, the character development was fantastic and I found myself laughing out loud through much of the book. The story refused to become mired in the atrocities of WWII. It was an uplifting, quick read, perfect for Christmas. ...more","review Another ponderous theme by Marilynne Robinson. I especially enjoyed the exceptional character development of Boughton.

(bk, it must have been the voice that ruined it for you!) This is the story of the prodigal son... the characters exhibit more patience and long suffering... This book demands a little patience and understanding from the reader, at least it did from me. It was well worth the time because Robinson shapes sentences so beautifully. ...more","review I wanted to read this book because it was a story the author used to tell his daughters to keep them entertained on long road trips... my dad used to I wanted to read this book because it was a story the author used to tell his daughters to keep them entertained on long road trips... my dad used to do the same and I wondered, what kinds of stories do other fathers tell their children? I wasn\u0027t disappointed. It\u0027s a very imaginative story, layered with stories. I found one of the most interesting aspects was that the author stayed as true as possible to real rabbit behavior. It\u0027s not a warm and fuzzy animal tale, so use caution if your little ones want to read it... ...more","review I\u0027ve heard so many great things about this book, that I guess I was expecting too much.
