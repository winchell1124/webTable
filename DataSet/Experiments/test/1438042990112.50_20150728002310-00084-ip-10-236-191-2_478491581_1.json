Now there are locks on every door, bars on all The Gist After attempting to break out of Lyle House, Chloe and Rae are locked up in new kind of prison. Now there are locks on every door, bars on all the windows, and a surveillance camera around every corner. All Chloe wants to do is to find a way out so she can get to Simon and Derek. But Rae seems perfectly content with her new home. She could care less about what happens to the guys. When an opportunity arises for Chloe to break free of the jail she takes it. Using her powers, Liz’s ghost, and some help from Tori (much to her surprise) they try to find Simon and Derek so that they can finish what they started. What We Think Reviewed by Dream Catcher I liked this book as much as the first, if not more. In the first one you’re just getting to know Chloe’s situation, and all of the new characters. But in the second one things start to get interesting. You find out the answers to questions that were asked in the first book. There’s more adventure. And there’s even a hint more romance, which I thought made the book even more exciting. The end of this book was a mini-cliffie (otherwise know as a miniature cliffhanger) which has me waiting (impatiently) for the third one to come out. I promise when reading this book you will not be disappointed. (p.s. the third book, The Reckoning, comes out April of 2010). If you liked the Summoning, then you will love the Awakening, I guarantee it. Real Teen Rating~ A+: Why are you still reading this, go buy this book NOW! Reviewed by The North Star I also loved this book but I think I liked it a lot more than the first book. As Dream Catcher said in the first book you only start to learn her situation but in this one you really get to learn about the characters, about there powers and a whole lot about the secret “Edison Group�?. Again like Dream Catcher said there is a little hint of romance!! It makes the book so much more enjoyable because it is so cute, (won’t say anymore I don’t want to give away what happens). This book asks a whole lot more questions that leave you hanging, but it answers almost all the questions asked in the first book. This book also has a whole lot more action. In the first book they are cooped up in the Lyle House, but in this book they have to run away from the “Edison Group�? so as you can imagine, it has a lot of action. The Awakening was also great because you got to learn about the character Tori a lot and she even though she played a semi-big part in the first book, in this one she is huge and you learn a lot about her backround. If you have read The Summoning you must read this book because it is magic!!!

Some of their closest friends are dying as a result of the war and Kronos is gaining power very quickly as more people join his army. Percy starts to put together an army to face of Kronos when he arrives in New York and his prophecy quickly starts to unfold, mysteries are brought up, things resolved and a battle that puts an end to everything. What We Think Reviewed by The North Star I thought that it was finally time that I reviewed the final Percy Jackson book so here it goes. This was one of my least favorite of the Percy Jackson books. Then thing I didn’t like about it was that not a lot really happened. I mean they had this huge battle but reading the book it was a little dry. The ending parts of the book was amazing but the beginning and middle part of the book were just ehh for me. I also didn’t like the character of Rachel Elizabeth Dare in this book because she was very whiny and there was this weird relationship between Percy and her. There were things that I did like about this book though. The whole big fight was great and all the things in the past books that you were scratching your head about where all cleared up in this book. All in all I think that it was a really good end to a series and although Rick Riordan will probably not right another Percy Jackson book for a while it’s OK because the ending was very satisfying. If you have followed the entire series then you should most definitely finish the series off with this book!!!!! Real Teen Rating~ A: Go Buy Now! Reviewed by Dream Catcher I couldn’t believe that this was the last book. I was so excited for this book to come out, but also a part of me didn’t want it to. I wanted the series to continue. I didn’t want it to end. But still, I got the book the first day I possible could and read it that same day. And finished it. One day was all it took to read one 300-something page book. That’s an accomplishment for me. Out of all the Percy Jackson books I have to say this one might me my favorite. It answered so many questions and had a lot of sweet Percabeth (Percy+Annabeth) romance. You finally get to learn about Percys prophecy and watch as he takes steps to defeat Kronos and his army. I also found this one of the saddest Percy Jackson books, but I won’t say why. Hint: they are in the middle of a WAR after all. This is the epic conclution to a stunning series. Read, laugh, cry, and complete the truly amazing Percy Jackson series.

The labyrinth was designed a long time ago by a man named Daedalus for King Minos. When Annabeth and Percy accidentally stumble into the entrance of the labyrinth they soon learn that Luke is going to invade Camp Half-Blood through the entrance of the labyrinth. Percy soon finds an old friend and together him, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson travel into the Labyrinth to find Daedalus and try and save Nico from Kronos (after he finds out he is the son of Hades) meaning that he may also be the child of the prophecy. What We Think Reviewed by The North Star Battle of the Labyrinth is my second favorite book in the Percy Jackson series. I really enjoyed this book because they go so many places in the Labyrinth that it had little mini stories within the big story. The reason I really enjoyed this book was because they brought back the character of Rachel Elizabeth Dare. She makes a quick appearance in the Titan’s Curse and in this book she becomes a huge character. Although at times she can get a little annoying she is a great add to the series. I’ve said it time and time again Rick Riordan is the master at putting in new characters and making them feel like they’ve been there the whole time. The other thing I LOVED about this book was the relationship between Percy and Annabeth. Through all the books they fight but you can see the romance beneath it and even though it’s small something happens in this book that you just can’t miss. Grover is also in this book and I love Grover he is the best character created ever! You will not be disappointed!

Again it’s up to Percy and his friends to find out w The Gist Artemis the goddess of the hunt has gone missing and the rumor is that she was kidnapped. Again it’s up to Percy and his friends to find out what happened. Now with the help of two new friends Thalia and Bianca. They must find Artemis before the winter solstice, her vote at the council could swing the issue about war with the titans. Percy also has to figure out what Artemis was hunting before she disappeared because it is said that this monster is so powerful it could destroy Olympus forever!! What We Think Reviewed by The North Star The Titan’s Curse is the third in the Percy Jackson series and is extremely important. Of course all the books are important but this book especially important because it sets off a chain-reaction of events that drive the rest of the series to their climax’s. The thing that I really enjoyed about this book was the same thing as the last one. With three new characters Riordan incorporates these new characters really really really well. It almost feels as if these characters have been there all along and you just haven’t noticed them. Thalia is definitely one of my new favorite characters because she is a strong woman who knows who she is and she isn’t afraid to stand up for what she believes in. I really enjoy her character because it creates someone else for Percy to talk to about having parents of “The Big Three�? besides Tyson. The other thing I really like about Thalia is that she is exactly like Percy. Annabeth actually says at one point, �? You guys are so alike it’s scary. Either you would have been best friends, or you would have strangled each other.�? Thalia may also now be the child in the prophecy. This book has also has a very big surprise in it and when I was reading it I couldn’t believe that it had happened. Hopefully, you’ll read this book so you can figure out what it is!!

The linger was the heat, the touch of feve The Gist The shiver was the cold, the promise of forgetting, the shift that hung in the air like a bad omen. The linger was the heat, the touch of fever, the animal inside clawing to get out. This is the story of a boy and a girl; of a wolf becoming a human and a human becoming a wolf. Grace and Sam have fought through everything to be together and now �? after battling the cold, the shift, and meningitis �? it finally seems like things could be settling down. Sam is still Sam despite the chilling winter, and Grace doesn’t have to worry about him shifting anymore, or wolves attacking. For a few simple, normal weeks, everything is perfect. Then things start to go downhill. Grace develops a mysterious illness no one can identify, one of Beck’s new wolves shifts back absurdly early, and Sam battles with memories of his damaging past. Their world crashes down around them as Grace’s parents become a stubborn and unwelcome force in her life, pushing Sam out, and desperation in. Sam’s wishful paper cranes are useless against the sickness ripping Grace from the inside out. Isabel and Cole’s (Beck’s new wolf) cold demeanor do nothing to save Grace from an illness they’re not sure she can cure. With stress building up, and anger boiling over, they figure it’s only a matter of time before somebody cracks. What We Think Reviewed by Dream Catcher When I picked up Shiver, not too long ago, and promptly finished it, I assumed it was a book that would stand alone. I never suspected another book �? it’s sequel �? would come along. But that didn’t stop me from nearly having a joyful heart-attack when I heard about Linger. Immediately I was jumping up and down with excitement, earnestly awaiting the published copy of Linger to appear in stores. After a few days of thought, however, I was a bit hesitant. How could it live up to the expectations I had set for it based on what Shiver was? I certainly didn’t want to be disappointed by it. But I shouldn’t have worried. Upon it’s arrival I was again overly enthusiastic - and for good reason. The book was amazing. The plot was very interesting and unexpected. The characters I knew from Shiver were just as real and unique. The new characters were mysterious and intriguing. I had half-expected the plot to be some fluff �? just filler so she could publish another book. It was most certainly not like that at all. There was romance, there was uncertainty, there was anguish, there were werewolves, and (much to everyone’s surprise) there was parenting. The plot had it all and kept me reading until I was finished. Then I immediately begged for more. As for the characters, they weren’t exactly different, but they seemed…deeper, almost. I felt for them even more than I had while I read Shiver. Grace and Sam seemed stronger (benefit of all that fighting to be together) and even more determined to get a happily-ever-after. Their sorrow in knowing they may never get it was moving. Isabel is just as mean and just as cold as she was before. But now (finally) a few blessed souls are trying to defrost her. This added something else to the book that I wasn’t expecting. Her resistance to kindness, I suppose. Then there was the one-of-a-kind compassion from Isabel which was something I never saw coming, but welcomed with open arms. And then there was Cole. Ah, Cole. No one will ever be sure what to make of him. Me included. He was an enigma; pure apathy personified. The addition of this character made the book a lot darker, and set it apart from Shiver. I can’t say anything civil about her parents, so you’ll have to read and decide for yourself about them. They also play a part in making the book dark and, well…somewhat depressing. Together, the fascinating plot and beloved characters make for a truly amazing book you’ll fall in love with instantly. My summary? Linger is a dark romance full of doubt and desperation. A book that will pull you in and only release you once you’ve finished the final word of the final page. Real Teen Rating~ A+ : Why are you still reading this, go buy this book NOW! Reviewed by The North Star The moment I finished Shiver I was both sad and happy at the same time. Happy because of the happy ending but sad because the book was over and then I heard that there was a sequel and I couldn’t believe what I was hearing and was overjoyed that there was going to be not only two books but THREE. I quickly got my hands on a copy and started reading it as soon as possible. I really couldn’t tell after finishing Linger whether I liked Shiver or Linger more. Linger was without a doubt more on the darker side in comparison to Shiver, but still very enjoyable. The thing that I loved most about Linger would have to be how the author just easily put people into the story and made characters who weren’t as big, bigger and pushed other characters to the back of your mind without allowing you to forget them completely. She brought the new character Cole into the story and at times I forgot that he wasn’t in the first book because his character was very natural. She also made Isabel a huge character in this book where in the last one she wasn’t as large and I liked seeing the story from her point of view because you didn’t really get a sense for what she was going through in Shiver. As Dream said this plot was unexpected and kept me on my toes the whole time. The other different thing about this book was that the book was told through Sam, Grace, Cole and Isabel’s point of view, which I really liked because then you could experience something new every chapter because there were almost 2 different stories going on. One story with Isabel and Cole and one with Sam and Grace, so by doing 4 different points of views you get two stories out of one! For people who read Shiver and loved how sweet Sam was shouldn’t worry because Sam is just as sweet in this book if not sweeter. The passion between him and Grace is also there so if there is any doubt as to whether that aspect will be there I wouldn’t worry at all. In the end, Linger is much more depressing than Shiver but almost equal in quality, you may even have a tear slide down your cheek. Real Teen Rating~ A+ : Why are you still reading this, go buy the book NOW! Reviewed by Living Destiny I was super excited when I heard that we had a copy of Linger to read, because I’d been waiting with a painful sort of anticipation for it to come out since I finished reading Shiver two months ago. My expectations for this book were pretty high, which I usually try to avoid with books, because with high expectations or hype I always find myself let down (The Hunger Games, anyone?) But with Linger I just couldn’t help myself. For once, I was not disappointed. Linger was incredible. That’s really all there is to it. The old characters were more developed, but in subtle ways. the new characters were interesting and filled in the story. I didn’t really think the series needed any more characters, but when I met Cole, I realized how there would have been a hole in the plot without him. He was a surprising character, and very hard to figure out. You couldn’t really pin him down to any stereotype, or even any one description. Like North, I thought it was cool how the story was told by four characters, instead of just the original two (Sam and Grace). It was fun to see what was going on from other perspectives, especially Isabel. In the first book, she wasn’t that big of a character, but she becomes much bigger in Linger. It’s nice to see her side, because she goes through a lot of pain and she has a very different train of thought than the other characters. It’s also nice to read from Cole’s perspective, because otherwise you wouldn’t get as much background on him. Hearing his thoughts gives you a better (though still meager) understanding of what he has gone through and is currently going through. And of course, hearing from Sam and Grace is always good, because their characters are the deepest, and I felt for them more because I knew them the best. The plot was so wild! I thought Shiver was intense, but this was ten times more heart stopping. Everything about it was so terrific and there were times when putting the book down was literally painful. And because the main characters were all so easy to connect to and understand, I really felt for them. Their pain, their excitement, their happiness, all of it. It was like, what they went through, I went through. There were times when I even imagined myself as the characters, and thought of what I would do in their places (and not too much changed!) I almost cried at the end. There, I said it. I almost cried. The ending was just so extremely, overwhelmingly sad! But it was like a good sad (not to be confused with a happy sad, because it was most definitely sad). It was depressing, but it felt right. Just as one final note: you know an author is good when they can make you feel strong emotion for their characters. Maggie Stiefvater is therefore amazing for making me feel such passionate hatred towards Grace’s parents. It was so bad I found myself having to put down the book and wait a couple of days before continuing. Linger was a great follow-up to Shiver, and an all around stunning book. I can’t think of any complaints, except maybe one: we have to wait a year for the last book, Forever?!?! NO FAIR!!! Real Teen Rating~ A+: Why are you still reading this, go buy the book NOW!

Connor Lassiter is too The Gist After the Second Civil War was fought, a law called the Bill of Life was passed. It legalized the murder of teenagers. Connor Lassiter is too much trouble for his parents. He gets into fights at school, does whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it, and is just simply too much to handle. But Connor isn’t stupid. He finds his signed Unwind Forms only a few weeks before his scheduled unwinding, and instead of going along with it, like most kids, he decides to kick AWOL and escape. Risa Ward is a ward of the state. Though her grades are great, her behavior is excellent, and her piano playing is superb, she’s just not special enough to be kept alive any longer. On her way to Harvest Camp �? the common name for an unwinding facility �? she gets her chance at freedom when her bus crashes on the high way, trying to avoid hitting some crazy unwind kid kicking AWOL. Lev Jedediah Calder is a tithe. A child born and raised solely for the purpose of being unwound. Lev is proud to have a purpose, he’s proud of who he is, and most importantly, he’s proud of being a tithe. On his way to Harvest Camp he’s kidnapped by two insane unwinds kicking AWOL, who are both convinced that by kidnapping him, they are saving him from the terrible fate of being unwound. Connor, Risa, and Lev run for their lives, just trying to make it to their eighteenth birthdays. Because by then, they’ll be adults. And killing adults is still against the law. What We Think Reviewed by Dream Catcher The first time I heard about this book was two years ago. My friend was reading it, and I remember being vaguely interested in it, but back then I didn’t really like those kinds of books. Ones that really creep you out and make you think about it late into the night. Two years later �? a.k.a now �? I saw it in the bookstore while buying books that were on my 2010 list. I read the back. I bought the book. I put the book on my list. I read it. I reviewed it. It was amazing. It was such a crazy idea I wasn’t sure if I was even going to be able to get through it. But I did, obviously, and it was one of the best books I’ve ever read. It’s also written in third person, which only added to my hesitation to read it in the first place. I usually don’t like third person books. I feel detached from the characters, while when reading first person, I feel as though I am one of the characters. But this was not the case here. The characters were well-developed, unique, and had many sides to them, which always makes things more interesting. Though the writing of this book, and the characters were really great, that wasn’t what made the book so phenomenal. It was the story itself. The plotline. The idea of it. It’s like the insane genius of books. It made me think about the future �? it’s a futuristic book, by the way �? and about human nature. A must read. Fantastic, spooky, and hopeful.

When she gets there she couldn’t feel more distant from everyone, especially her dad. Her first day couldn’t be more confusing she meets some new friends, and two of those friends instantly fall in love with her. At lunch that day she meets the guy of every girls dreams, Edward Cullen. From the moment she saw him he was all she could think about. At night she imagined him in her room and everywhere she went she felt he was watching her. When she finally gets the nerve to talk to him in biology it’s a connection right away. That is until she finds out he is a vampire. From that point on Bella is sucked into the world of vampires, werewolves ect. Edward tells her that they are “vegetarian�? meaning they only suck the blood of animals. Soon after finding out everything about each other Bella figures out that they are soul mates and Edward will stop at NOTHING to save her from danger, and when more vampires come to Forks, Edward will do anything to save Bella from James who is trying to kill her. What We Think Reviewed by The North Star I’m not afraid to admit it but like most people who read this book when I first read it I was OBSESSED. It was unhealthy how obsessed I was. I wanted Edward to be real so that I could marry him and he could turn me into a vampire. After a while I came off my obsession and re-read the book to see if I would be as obsessed as the first time. I wasn’t but I realized that it was a great book with a lot of detail that I didn’t notice reading it the first time through. Stephanie Meyer is a great writer and although I am quite fed up with all the stupid things they are selling for Twilight the books are really good (although if you are a guy i recommend not reading them unless you into that stuff). I’m sorry for the many people in the world who don’t get to read the book because they already know what happens or they are just sick of all the hype about it. This book is really a good one the characters are very well developed and by the end of the 4th book you know so much about them it’s almost as if they are your family. So if you are one of the people who is sick of Twilight I still think you should read the book because you will probably enjoy it, trust me this is coming from a reformed Twilight obsess e. Real Teen Rating~ A- : Read it! :) Reviewed by Dream Catcher All right. I’ll admit it. I was obsessed. But, I’m happy to report, not as obsessed as most people. Sure, I loved the book and I enjoyed talking about it, but I didn’t fall in love with any of the characters. I know how irrational it would be to love a fictional vampire. Sorry to anyone who might take offense to that. Of course I wanted someone like Edward to be real (come on, what girl doesn’t want a perfect guy?) but, I knew the chances were slim to none. At least in high school. After getting over my obsession, like the North Star, I was sick and tired of hearing all the talk of Twilight, or seeing the stupid products made about Twilight. I’d had enough of it, and it got annoying fast. But when I reread parts of it, I realized why everyone was still talking about it. It was because it was good. Despite what some might say, Stephenie Meyer is a good writer, and the books that she has written are very good. The characters are well developed �? so you really do feel connected to them (except sometimes Bella whines too much. So two guys are fighting over you. Pick your “true love”�?�s side and get over it!). The writing is far better than most authors�?. The book was well-written. The only thing is that the plot left a lot to be desired. It was a very simple romance. I kind of wished she’s put more into it. Still, it was very good and worth the read. Even if you’re an extreme Twilight-hater, I would still recommend this book to you. Don’t hate me for that.

Jacob then soon reveals to her he also has dreams about the same things that are happening. Now they have to team up to find out who the murderer is and stop him before someone else is hurt. What We Think Reviewed by The North Star I apologize for the very bad gist above. I have not read this book in a long time so I tried to write from what I remember. I liked this book better than Blue is for Nightmares. I think that she evolved the characters much more in this book than in the first book. I also loved the character of Jacob, he is probably one of my favorite characters ever in a series. Unlike Edward, he has flaws and isn’t afraid to admit to them. The other thing that I liked about this book was that they brought back her past with the little girl that she used to babysit. In the first book she left it very open ended about what happened with her so I was ecstatic when she decided to write the whole book basically about Maura. With almost every book though you get some negatives. The one thing that really bothered me in this book was Chad. He was extremely awkward while dating Stacey in this book. I’m not sure why he was just the way he acted around Stacey was just very strange and it seemed as he was trying to make the relationship work when both of them knew it wouldn’t. Other than the awkwardness between Stacey and Chad I really enjoyed this book and if you liked Blue is for Nightmares then you guaranteed to love White is for Magic.

She performs spells to keep the dreams away or in some cases revel them. One day when she dreams about her best friend Drea and a psycho stalker she makes her first priority saving her but time is running out and she has to use every spell in the book to save her. What We Think Reviewed by The North Star Blue is for Nightmares is the first book in the Blue is for Nightmares Series and is one of my favorite series ever. I read this and the second book in literally a day. I found them very interesting with all the spells and the characters are very normal (besides Stacey). This book was a great read because the setting of the book was believable. In most fiction books they take place in faraway lands or secrets places on the earth that no one knows about except for the characters but in this book they are set on a local boarding school. The thing that i didn’t like about this book was the character Drea. I mean I liked her but she gets jealous really easy so at times she can get super annoying. Other than that I think that Laurie did a fantastic job of explaining the characters feelings for each other and I can always read a good flirt fight between Amber and PJ. Real Teen Rating~ A: Go Buy Now Reviewed by Dream Catcher I first read these books in eighth grade. I was browsing the classroom library of my current english teacher and came across Blue is for Nightmares. A friend of mine had been raving about it. It was so unique. It was like nothing she’d ever read. It was sooooo good! Yeah, right I thought. But I had to admit, I was intrigued. So I checked it out of the library and read it in a few days. It really was as good as my friend had described! Though Stacey’s friends Amber and Drea were a bit weird they were charming, and definitely likable. PJ, who constantly changes his hair color, also constantly flirts, which always got me to laugh. Chad, love interest to nearly everyone, was sweet and lovable (which is good considering the whole love interest thing). For characters, she was right on, and the plot was just as good, in my opinion. It was creepy and sketchy and was different from anything else I’d ever read. The whole idea of Wicca is seriously interesting. There was never a point in the book I wasn’t entertained. Seriously. As for this book versus the others in the series, I think this was my favorite or at least, one of my favorites. Really good, and I would definitely recommend it. Overview: A fast-paced, Wiccan thriller that left me turning page after page, desperate to know how it ends. Real Teen Rating~ A : Go Buy Now. Reviewed by Living Destiny I read this series because, once again, I was out of books to read. This happens to me a lot. So my friends recommended the Blue is for Nightmares series, because they thought it was amazing. Sure, why not, I thought. I had nothing to read, and I was desperate. So I read the first book. It was better than I thought it would be. It wasn’t really a thriller book, but it sort of was. It was very exciting! I really loved Amber and PJ. They were two of my favorite characters, because they could make any situation lighter, and they were always cracking jokes, or getting into some intense flirt session. Which was funny in a strange sort of way. Chad was irritating to me, but he was a good guy. It wasn’t his fault that he was caught in between two girls. Drea was rude and bratty sometimes, but she was also sweet. The only character I really had a problem with was Stacey, the main character. She just struck me as too whiny and needy. True, she was under a lot of stress, but she was still super annoying. But it was good that all the characters had some flaws, because it makes them sound more human. Characters who are perfect seem so fake. The plot was entertaining, and I liked the whole magic/Wiccan theme. It was a nice change that the spells weren’t so otherworldly. They were more natural, and weren’t necessarily dark or evil. The magic was all easy to imagine being real, where in most books with spells, the magic is unrealistic and absurd. This book was great. Not exceptional, but it was a good read, and it sucked me in pretty well. It convinced me to read the rest of the series, and if a book makes you keep reading, it’s always a good sign, right?
