So just a couple weeks later than a lot of people though., 58535\u003dI believe that the release date will be 7/30/2007. Why this day a week day? Well, it is Harry’s birthday. Why not release your last book on his birthday., 67055\u003dI think it should come out late 2006. mainly because I love Harry Potter. Iv been waiting for it to come out!!!!!!!!!!, 50526\u003dEnough from me for now. Though I will be back. ^^ I like discussing possiblities for the future book. Here’s hoping for a 2007 release date., 26138\u003dI agree that a longer release date is better. It builds up suspense to think that she is actually working on it this long. But I also believe that the movies spaced so far apart just isn’t fair. I wanted to go to the movies to see the fifth movie this november, but now I have to wait about another year to see it. I think that the seventh book should be longer than the fifth book because it is the last book of the series. Can’t wait till it comes out! Harry Potter will last forever!, 82571\u003dyou know i cant believe it might be released on 7-7-07 gods number. which is a coincidence in whice all of my names first middle and last all have 7 letters. shannon michael metcalf. A.K.A(The-thing) all my names are 7 so it’s 777 gods number. that’s freaking awesome. I also have some questions. Does Snape really help harry? Is harry going to die with one of his friends? I actually think now and believe that harry is voldemorts last horcruxe. i think harry potter might have to kill himself to stop voldemort because harry himself has become voldemorts last horcrux. and i also beleive that harry potter is godric gryffindors heir. which makes voldemort slytherins heir. so harry was a part of godric which makes him voldemorts secondary thing., 90929\u003dWell 7/7/07 makes sense because with the 5th and 6th she seems to have it planned for when she will release it because for her since it is a magical book it needs to have a magical meaning for when the rest of the world is aloud to see it. And also some tid bits for you to chew on and think. One of my friends was able to confirm it coming out in 2007, Krum comes back, you see bills wedding, harry visits grodrics hollow, someone important dies, you find out more about dumbledores past, you find out who R.A.B. is, and you see the confrontation between harry and voldemort and finally find out where snapes loyalties truly lay. hope this has gotten you all thinking more about this book., 114731\u003dThe book will not be released on July 7th, 2007. That is because it is a saturday�? However, a more likely idea is that it would be released on the 3rd or 4th as that is about the same day of the summer books 5 and 6 were released., 108101\u003dFor the release date, you should also consider The Order Of The Phoenix movie date. The next film is expected in June 2007 so both release dates would correspond. This would boost either the book sales since after seeing the movie viewers will be encoraged to continue the story and read the final book., 16924\u003d7/7/07 for book 7 sounds like fun and all, but really in the end does it matter as much as who J.K. Rowling is going to kill off in the end? I mean if she kills voldemort then ok, yeah, how predictable. If she kills Harry then ok, a lot of people hate her now. I just thought of something on the date, 7/7/07. “isn’t 7 the most powerfully magical number�?(The Half Blood Price.) J.k Rowling i think was planning on 7 books and 2007 to release this book, but the exact date??? I don’t know., 128162\u003dAbout three weeks ago, I got together with a few other Harry Potter fans to discuss the story. One of the topics that came up was the release date for the final book. Somebody (don’t remember who, sorry) said that they heard it would be published in 2007. This lead to speculation about the actual release date, which we predict will be July 7, 2007. This will be a Saturday (Friday night/Saturday morning at midnight), just like the last few books. Besides, since 7 is the most powerful magical number, how could the 7th book possibly be released on any other date than 7/7/7 (2007-07-07)?, 92338\u003dIf you guys look on Joanne’s ‘site, yiou would see ythat it comes out on July 7th 2006- THAT’S THIS YEAR}","TableContextTimeStampAfterTable":"{12604\u003d2014 Zero-to-Hero blogging challenge}","textBeforeTable":"I agree with jason. I would much rather wait for an excellent book, instead of getting a merely decent book “on time�?. I do think they rushed book 6, to its detriment. I also agree (partially) with Crystal: I was ready for book 7 as soon as I finished book 6. I think Jay is confusing the day we all spent waiting in line for the book with its actual release date. See the table below. Books 4-6 have all been released on Saturdays. These are the “post HP mania�? books. Prior volumes (1-3) were all released in the UK before they were sold in the US. This post has been getting a lot of traffic lately–it’s now one of my most popular of all time. So I figured it’s a good time to weigh in with replies to some earlier comments. 2006-04-10 at 19:02 UTC says: jim Reply The book will not be released on July 7th, 2007.

It also helps explain the agonizing delay between books 4 and 5. My family and I always thought it was entirely due to J.K. Rowling’s sudden celebrity and involvement with the first movie. But now I see our error: We assumed JKR was writing volumes 1-4 as fast as they were being published in the United States (4 novels in under 2 years!!), when she had actually been turning them out in the UK almost exactly a year apart.
