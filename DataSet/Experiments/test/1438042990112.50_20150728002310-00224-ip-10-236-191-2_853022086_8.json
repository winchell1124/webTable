parodies frequently make comedic use of the fourth wall, breaking character, and meta-references. Within an ostensibly self-contained storyline, the characters may refer to the technical aspects of filmmaking, the publicity, hype, or box office surrounding their project, their own past roles, any clichés being used, and so on. In 2013, Film Comment wrote, \"While film studies majors gasp over the deconstruction of genre in the works of David Lynch and the meta-movies of Charlie Kaufman, \u0027the usual gang of idiots\u0027 over at MAD have been deconstructing, meta-narrativing, and postmodernizing motion pictures since the very first movie parody (Hah! Noon!) appeared in 1954\"[1] (though Mad\u0027s first movie parody was actually \"Ping Pong\")., 7081\u003dThese articles typically cover five pages or more, and are presented as a sequential storyline with caricatures and word balloons. The opening page or two-page splash usually consists of the cast of the show introducing themselves directly to the reader; in some parodies, the writers sometimes attempt to circumvent this convention by presenting the characters without such direct exposition. (In 1973, the movie poster for The Long Goodbye was designed in the introductory style of a Mad parody, including the rectangular word balloons, and drawn by Mad regular Jack Davis.)}","TableContextTimeStampAfterTable":"{3328\u003dThe following writers and illustrators, both past and current, are Mad\u0027s most prolific film spoofs writers and illustrators of all-time (as of April 4, 2012).
