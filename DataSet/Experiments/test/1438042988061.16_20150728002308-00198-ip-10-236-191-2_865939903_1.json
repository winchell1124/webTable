Everett Rogers, a professor of communication studies, popularized the theory in his book Diffusion of Innovations; the book was first published in 1962, and is now in its fifth edition (2003).[1] Rogers argues that diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the participants in a social system. The origins of the diffusion of innovations theory are varied and span multiple disciplines. Rogers proposes that four main elements influence the spread of a new idea: the innovation itself, communication channels, time, and a social system. This process relies heavily on human capital. The innovation must be widely adopted in order to self-sustain. Within the rate of adoption, there is a point at which an innovation reaches critical mass. The categories of adopters are: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards.[2] Diffusion manifests itself in different ways in various cultures and fields and is highly subject to the type of adopters and innovation-decision process.}","TableContextTimeStampAfterTable":"{10782\u003dDiffusion occurs through a five–step decision-making process. It occurs through a series of communication channels over a period of time among the members of a similar social system. Ryan and Gross first identified adoption as a process in 1943.[36] Rogers\u0027 five stages (steps): awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption are integral to this theory. An individual might reject an innovation at any time during or after the adoption process. Abrahamson examined this process critically by posing questions such as: How do technically inefficient innovations diffuse and what impedes technically efficient innovations from catching on? Abrahamson makes suggestions for how organizational scientists can more comprehensively evaluate the spread of innovations.[37] In later editions of Diffusion of Innovation, Rogers changes his terminology of the five stages to: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. However, the descriptions of the categories have remained similar throughout the editions., 40162\u003dPeres, Muller and Mahajan suggested that diffusion is \"the process of the market penetration of new products and services that is driven by social inﬂuences, which include all interdependencies among consumers that affect various market players with or without their explicit knowledge\".[69]}","lastModified":"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 10:24:18 GMT","textBeforeTable":"The key elements in diffusion research are: Elements[edit] In 1962 Everett Rogers, a professor of rural sociology, published his seminal work: Diffusion of Innovations.

These qualities interact and are judged as a whole. For example, an innovation might be extremely complex, reducing its likelihood to be adopted and diffused, but it might be very compatible with a large advantage relative to current tools. Even with this high learning curve, potential adopters might adopt the innovation anyway.[22] Studies also identify other characteristics of innovations, but these are not as common as the ones that Rogers lists above.[23] The fuzziness of the boundaries of the innovation can impact its adoption. Specifically, innovations with a small core and large periphery are easier to adopt.[24] Innovations that are less risky are easier to adopt as the potential loss from failed integration is lower.[25] Innovations that are disruptive to routine tasks, even when they bring a large relative advantage, might not be adopted because of added instability. Likewise, innovations that make tasks easier are likely to be adopted.[26] Closely related to relative complexity, knowledge requirements are the ability barrier to use presented by the difficulty to use the innovation.
