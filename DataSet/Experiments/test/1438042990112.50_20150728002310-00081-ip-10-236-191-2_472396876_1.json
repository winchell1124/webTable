Fyodor gave us a every descriptive account of the story, with interesting conversations, plot twists (which kept you guessing whats going to happen next), and so much more.

Whether you are an Extrovert or an Introvert, You\u0027ll find that if you are an Introvert that there is nothing wrong with you its just many (mostly Extroverts?) shun or think they are \u0027dumb or stupid\u0027 (which is quite the contrary) when in fact Introverts are incredible people and we should learn to understand them and give them their room to explore their inner mind. For Extroverts they\u0027ll (hopefully) learn that about 1/3 of the people you know are Introverts and are not quite as out going, loud persons you think they should be. Yes Introverts can become \u0027quasi-Extroverted\u0027 at times, but they are still an Introvert at heart. About a few months ago I learned that I was a Introvert, I kinda thought something was wrong about me, but reading this book and doing my own research on Introversion I found comfort in what I read online and in Quiet that Introverts are amazing people. ...more","review For years I\u0027ve seen this book laying on my parents bookshelf and always thinking \u0027I\u0027d never read that\u0027 or \u0027I wouldn\u0027t learn anything from that old boo For years I\u0027ve seen this book laying on my parents bookshelf and always thinking \u0027I\u0027d never read that\u0027 or \u0027I wouldn\u0027t learn anything from that old book\u0027.

I have learned some new tricks to use when talking to someone and wanting to achieve something without being harsh or mean, but saying it in a nice way like praising some thing they do good and ending with a suggestion. I think there were some points in this book that I have already done with my conversations with others, but it was a nice refresher to read those parts. I know I\u0027ll have to read parts of this book over now and then to get a refresher on some of the ways mentioned in this book. ...more","review I\u0027d like to thank Goodreads for having the First Reads program so that many of the average readers can read a book before it hits the stores. A Blaze I\u0027d like to thank Goodreads for having the First Reads program so that many of the average readers can read a book before it hits the stores. A Blaze of Glory: A Novel of the Battle of Shiloh is the first book I ever won from Goodreads\u0027 First Reads program and I hope to win future books and give a review for the book. This book is the first book I\u0027ve ever read from Jeff Shaara. The story takes place with the events before Shiloh and eventually leads up to the battle of Shiloh. Portrayed by both North \u0026 South\u0027s Generals like: Grant, Johnston and Sherman you get to see both sides of the story with thoughts about their family, troops, death, difficulties and other things that might be going through their mind. Jeff puts in detail of sounds and din\u0027s like: slushing sound of mud, thunder, musket fire and other small details to make the story come alive. I\u0027ll have to say there were a few parts here and there that were quite humorous to not feel like the book is all about war and death. It was a pleasure to be one of the First Readers to read A Blaze of Glory: A Novel of the Battle of Shiloh. ...more","review This book is a necessary read for all readers/lovers of pirate/swashbuckling/treasure hunting books (and the alike). Robert Louis Stevenson\u0027s Treasure This book is a necessary read for all readers/lovers of pirate/swashbuckling/treasure hunting books (and the alike). Robert Louis Stevenson\u0027s Treasure Island was possibly one the first books to revolutionize this genre, although I have heard many of the items like treasure maps, schooners, one-legged seamen, parrots were made up by Stevenson and have become \u0027popular misconceptions\u0027 about pirates. I remember watching the movie \u0027Treasure Planet\u0027 back some years ago and I looked it up some information about it and found it was based on a book and told my self \u0027that book is old as hell I won\u0027t ever read that old book\u0027. Well I guess I out did my self and gave in to read it to see what all the hype was about this book and pirates. I\u0027ll have to say the story line was quite interesting with many interesting characters. I did find some parts of the book to be a little confusing, hence the 4 stars. My favorite characters would have to be Ben Gunn and Long John Silver. I\u0027ll definitely read this book again in the future. ...more","review I\u0027m not sure what to think of this book.

I did have some notes found in the back which helped some, but some weren\u0027t too helpful. I think somewhere around reading 1/3 of this book I kinda lost interest in this book and I can see why. I should stayed with the former and quitted this book early on, I thought it might have gotten better, but I thought wrongly.

I can only second Robert Lewis Stevenson\u0027s review: \u0027A piece of perfect storytelling.\u0027 because it is dam near well close to a perfect storytelling, although there were parts that seemed to drag on about history and such the rest of the book made up for it. Whilst reading this book I came across a multitude of words that I knew about but didn\u0027t know their meaning too well and some new words, that improved my vocabulary. Going on with the vocabulary I\u0027d say that this translation of Count of Monte Cristo is a excellent version, although there might be many difficult words for some people to keep track and I\u0027d recommend having a dictionary with you and pen and paper to keep track of the words you have come across already. As a closing word I\u0027d like to say that I\u0027m not sure if one influenced the other or if it might be a coincidence that some parts of this book felt like parts were from Les Misérables, yet it felt like a completely new book. ...more","review Initially when looking at reviews online and such I found many mixed reviews that some liked it and others loved this book. At first I was quite hesit Initially when looking at reviews online and such I found many mixed reviews that some liked it and others loved this book. At first I was quite hesitant to read this book because I might not like the book or find Rand\u0027s work unimportant for today\u0027s world. I found it to be just the opposite, I actually loved this book, there might have been some small parts that I didn\u0027t understand but for the most part I enjoyed this book. I read this in one setting, which was quite nice. I think there are groups or societies and maybe people(?) that, in a way, are depicted in Anthem, that if you try to challenge their values they may attack you in some form or another. In other words you can take the \u0027we\u0027, that is consistent through out the book, and place some group/organization/society/etc. as the \u0027we\u0027. It may not apply to every thing you substitute as the \u0027we\u0027 but I think you get the idea. I got quite a bit out of reading this short novel. It even made me think for some time after reading about the ideas and themes and how to apply them to today\u0027s world. I hope Rand\u0027s work in Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged is as good or even better than Anthem because I plan on reading them some time soon. ...more","review I\u0027m not too sure what to say about this book.
