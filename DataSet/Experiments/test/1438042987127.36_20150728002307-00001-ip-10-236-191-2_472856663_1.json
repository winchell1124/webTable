It\u0027s so pretty and I just love it! On the Wicked Lovely site (wickedlovely.com) there\u0027s a reasoning behind the cover, so I\u0027ll post that. Ash is holding a flower that should die beacuse of the snow, but doesn\u0027t because she is the Summer Queen. (The flower/snow thing is from Keenan \u0026 Beira\u0027s conversation when Beira crushes the flower he is causing to grow.) The vines are ivy from the Summer Girls. Ash is really Aislinn, her nickname is Ash. So the content. I really liked the plot and the concept really drew me in. The details were lacking only slightly, and I love how Aislinn is this really strong character who is intent on ignoring Keenan and Beira. After hearing Ash, it reminded me of the Iron Fey, and I started wondering if that\u0027s how Julie got her name for our super-hot Winter prince. (How can a prince of Winter be hot? It confused me, too.) Maybe she did, but I really wish she hadn\u0027t because I want that name! Julie likes the Wicked Lovely series, so that may be it, but just thought I\u0027d point that out, only because I\u0027m obsessed, as you can obviously tell. The descriptions were lacking, like I said before, and I felt it was really slow and sluggish, and not the type of action I usually love. Also, I (SPOILER ALERT!) hate how Seth ends up with Aislinn, and how Keenan sort-of ends up with Donia. I was absolutely livid, because although Keenan annoyed me at first, I warmed up to him. *Winces* Bad pun, I know, since he is the Summer King. And then he ended up with the Winter Queen, and I just was so mad I wanted to hurl the book. (SPOILER ENDED!)

So I definitely think the beginning was dry and sluggish. But then there was this sort of \"trigger point\" that finally engaged me and I started to like it. It was dramatic and scandalous, sort of, and very romantic. When it comes to anything purely historical fiction, I will literally RUN in the other direction. And this book definitely exceeded my--albeit low--expectations and I\u0027ll definitely be reading the next book. This book ended up proving itself and being a pretty good read because I loved the characters, the plot, and the drama that was involved, despite the sluggish beginning and lack of attention it drew.

The cover is beautiful, first Once again, Cassandra Clare captures me with the cover, the characters, the details, the whole way she writes the book. The cover is beautiful, first of all. I love how they chose Clary with her hair flying everywhere. I love the New York skyline under her, and I love the art they used for the words. Also, she included the series title and the book number. So many novels completely forget to put the book number if it\u0027s in a series and so many forget to put the series title! The only problem I might have with the cover is the title. I don\u0027t exactly understand how it ties in to everything. I got how the City of Bones had its title because Clary went to the Bone City to help remove (SPOILER COMING NEXT. YOU MIGHT WANT TO SKIP THE SENTENCE) the block that her mother put into her head. The characters absolutely blew me away. You can obviously tell that Clary\u0027s grown and gotten stronger. Her insecurites are there, and you can definitely see the chemistry between her and Jace, especially in this one scene that I will not go into detail because of spoilers. Let\u0027s just say that it was my favorite scene. (Page 169-174) You can also see Jace\u0027s struggles with his feelings toward Clary. Jace obviously cares about Clary so much and will go to the ends of the earth to ensure her happiness. Now for the content. Let me just say that Cassandra\u0027s plotline was so magnificent and so intricate that it took everything I had to stop reading this book for dinnertime. I love the way everything\u0027s pulled together so well and you\u0027re always on your toes because you just have to keep guessing. The only problem I had with this book was the abundant use of \"said.\" I know, really cheesy, but I just can\u0027t get over it. I hate when authors continue to use \"said\" over and over again. And as I said before, I had a little bit of a problem with the titel, because I don\u0027t think the Ash City or the City of Ashes came up once in the book. I reccomend this book to anyone into paranormal romance! ...more","review I really, really, really, really, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, definitely loved this book. Every last thing. My only complaint was the cover was I really, really, really, really, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, definitely loved this book. Every last thing. My only complaint was the cover wasn\u0027t as pretty as I would\u0027ve liked it, but it still captured every thing about the book: dreaming and Janie going into these dreams involuntarily. And I wish the book was longer. I definitely want to read the next book now. This book is a little inappropriate, with a lot of uses of the \"f\" word. And from the summary, there\u0027s lots of...you know...stuff. You know what I mean. I loved the romance that Janie had with Cabel, and it was really tragic, because Janie thought that Cabel was a total player, when really he was trying to protect Janie. Cabel is the only person who knows about Janie\u0027s...gift. And Janie feels that he\u0027s the only person that Janie can talk to truthfully, and then he blows her off on this date, and Janie\u0027s dreams are shattered. So most of the book (which isn\u0027t a lot) Cabel protects Janie without her knowing it, but Janie avoids Cabel, even though he loves her and she does, too. She just doesn\u0027t know it. The ending was satisfactory, with Cabel and Janie finding each other again. They are definitely in love, and I got that fluttery feeling in my stomach whenever something romantic enough. That means that the romance has to be seriously well-written, which it definitely was. Thanks, Anna (my school friend) for recommending this series to me! And now that I\u0027ve recommended it to you, go and read it yourselves! ...more","review I can\u0027t give this book a rating because I hate biographies so that\u0027d be unfair, but I cannot tell you how boring and dry it was that I read (for real) I can\u0027t give this book a rating because I hate biographies so that\u0027d be unfair, but I cannot tell you how boring and dry it was that I read (for real) 50 pages.

First of all Okay, I\u0027ve been aiming to make my reviews a little longer, so let me see if that\u0027s possible. And BTW, the rating is four-point-five stars. First of all, the cover. It is so cool, and if I could include a picture *twitches* I\u0027m sure you\u0027d agree with me. I love the title, too, it\u0027s so catchy. And also, I was just so shocked at the end when Jace and Clary found out that they were... hey, I almost spoiled everything... I have got to watch my mouth �? er, fingers. But continuing with the cover: I love the colors and everything on it. I especially loved Jace and the glowy things on his body, although I don\u0027t know why he\u0027s on the cover instead of Clary. But, Cassie Clare must have a motive behind it, right? Second, the content. During the first few chapters, I wasn\u0027t as hooked that I had to keep turning and turning the pages, but after I got to chapter five or four, Cassie had reeled me in and claimed me as her victim. Everything was really detailed and the concept and the entire plot was so well laid out. I think she really delivered where the details and plot was concerned. And the love triangle going on between Clary, Jace, and Simon is like a love triangle, and Clary is so naive that she doesn\u0027t know of Simon\u0027s feelings until it smacks her in the face. Finally, the characters. Clary was a strong and independent protagonist, so I really liked that about her. Nowadays, a lot of the heroines are making so many mistakes and even though if I �? or anyone else, for that matter �? were in their shoes, they wouldn\u0027t make the same stupid mistakes. So I was very pleased that they didn\u0027t mess up in dumb ways. Jace was captivating and conceited. He seems to slowly ease out of his self-centered ways after a little bit of prodding and goading, and that was something else I liked. Now, the inevitable comes. I must compare it with my favorite series, the Iron Fey. I\u0027m going to start this as a new thing, comparing it with my favorite series so far (and for songs I\u0027ll do it with my favorite artist or song so far). It was better because a lot more twists and turns were thrown into our way. It wasn\u0027t as good because I like those relationships that are hard and the guy isn\u0027t opening up the way the girl wants, but I still like ones where it\u0027s vice-versa, where the guy is trying to get the un-budging girl. I still liked this kind of romance, though, where they both seemed to be falling for each other without noticing it until a lot later. And of course, there has to be action and heartbreak in the romance or what good is it? That\u0027s my opinion, you may disagree. Anyway, if you don\u0027t like paranormal romance (and that\u0027s basically what I read. Of course, there will always be some mystery or action-adventure thrown in, which I also like) I wouldn\u0027t recommend it. But if you\u0027re a sucker for this stuff, by all means, dive right in! Once again, happy Halloween and happy reading! ...more","review This gets three stars.

There was some adventure, although it wasn\u0027t very suspenseful. The movie in my opinion was better, and I usually never say that. This book just didn\u0027t cut it for me in the action and adventure department. It was really good, but it\u0027s for kids and didn\u0027t have romance. There was a little fantasy and paranormal stuff, I guess, but still, it wasn\u0027t enough to cut it. The movie had more action and I liked that one better. There\u0027s not really much more to say about this topic other than it lacked the finesse I usually crave in a book and wasn\u0027t my type of genre. On the positive side, I can say the characters were well developed, the descriptions were great, and there were many details that really brought you into the book with Lina and Doon. ...more","review None","review Check out more of my reviews at ***Singing and Reading in the Rain***! Many people have already fallen in love with Thirteen Reasons Why and you could Check out more of my reviews at ***Singing and Reading in the Rain***! Many people have already fallen in love with Thirteen Reasons Why and you could say that I agree with them. It wasn\u0027t an extremely emotional novel that I fell in love with like Twenty Boy Summer by Sarah Ockler, but Thirteen Reasons Why was definitely a roller coaster full of different feelings. The idea of set of tapes depicting why a girl killed herself circulating through a number of people was absolutely gripping and so original that I had to read it and see for myself if I loved it. I definitely really enjoyed it but it didn\u0027t make it to my \"favorites\" shelf. When Clay first got these tapes, I was so ready to see what Clay did to get on the tapes, because he was made out to be a really great and nice character. However, that\u0027s all I ever knew about him. I felt so disconnected with the characters in Thirteen Reasons Why mainly because it was mostly just the tapes talking and I never really got to know who Clay really was. I wanted to be able to understand his character, his personality, but I wasn\u0027t able to and he was a really flat character to me. However, I really did love Hannah\u0027s story. Hannah was sort of like the dominant narrator in Thirteen Reasons Why and you sort of understood why she went through with suicide. Suicide is such a serious subject and you can\u0027t joke around with it anymore, since so many people are going through with it. And you can\u0027t go through with something this serious without having a solid reason and I could tell all the pain and suffering that Hannah was going through and what finally pushed her over the edge. Every story that was discussed in Thirteen Reasons Why enchanted me. I really wanted to hear every reason why Hannah ended up committing suicide, and I even went onto the site, Hannah\u0027s Reasons, that was set up so you could hear the tapes yourself if you wanted to. The story as a whole was actually extremely gripping and got you engaged. You really wanted to go back and keep reading. You really wanted to hear all thirteen reasons why she died. I know I did. Although the characters fell a little flat for me, Thirteen Reasons Why was a twirl-a-whirl (is that what they\u0027re called?) of emotions and sorry feelings. Trust me when I say that Thirteen Reasons Why will be an amazingly emotional novel for anybody who enjoyed Twenty Boy Summer by Sarah Ockler. ...more","review None","review Wow.

I read this book and all I have to say is wow. I\u0027m so glad this is being made into a movie because it so deserves to be made into a movie! The action is great. The action was great, and the fact that Katniss sacrificed herself to save Prim just melted my heart. When the Hunger Games started, you see how much of a drunk Haymitch is and how crucial he is to the entire thing. And then Katniss and Peeta, while going through the pre-Games scoring rituals, they end up revealing things about them that probably isn\u0027t the best thing. Like for example, Peeta\u0027s secretly in love with Katniss, and Katniss is a really big threat to all the tributes because of her kick-butt archery skills. At the end of all this hectic business, there\u0027s a twist that I didn\u0027t see coming and I thought it was great in setting up the next few books. You guys have probably all read it, but for those who haven\u0027t, I\u0027m not spoiling it. I just think you should read this trilogy because it\u0027s a great trilogy and this book was the perfect book for setting up what would happen in Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I know I\u0027ll be watching the Hunger Games movie. What about you? ...more","review The cover is so stinking cool!

I love how the book spine matches her skirt (you can\u0027t see it in the above picture, unfortunately, but the pattern is the same), and I love the font of the title. I think it\u0027s cool how she made it with the clippings. The only problem I do have with the cover is the title, actually. It\u0027s sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long! I wish she could\u0027ve come up with a snappier one, and it doesn\u0027t really pertain to the content. It\u0027s just a title. Another thing was that I wish I could see the girl\u0027s face. This actually isn\u0027t a complaint, I just wish Ally would show us sometime soon. In this book, I felt like Cammie grew very little as a character. In the next books, I think she grew a little more, but in the first two books, it was like she was living life and kept making the same mistakes. Also, in the book, a group of boys from the Blackthorne Institute for spy-boys comes for a semester. Cammie finds out about this school very early in the book, before this field trip for CoveOps. In the beginning, Cammie gets taken on a field trip where someone she doens\u0027t know tails her and she has to get to this specific destination on time. She thinks she\u0027s doing fine, until a mysterious boy refuses to let her go. Being all naive, she tells him where she\u0027s headed, not knowing that this boy is Cammie\u0027s tail. Later, Cammie finds out that the boy, Zach, was her tail, and that he\u0027s from Blackthorne. The scene goes like this: (not the exact phrasing, taken from pages 76 and 77) \"You\u0027re late.\" (Mr. Solomon, they\u0027re CoveOps teacher) \"But I\u0027m alone.\" (Cammie) \"No, Ms. Morgan, you\u0027re not.\" (Solomon) Zach steps out from the shadows and smiles. \"Hi again, Gallagher Girl.\" Cammie is dumbfounded, when Mr. Solomon says, \"Nice, work, Zach.\" Zach winks at Cammie, much to her horror. \"Hi, Blackthorne Boy.\" Cammie manages to say, and Zach gapes, Mr. Solomon blinks. So, that\u0027s that. Zach and Cammie eventually grow close, even though Zach is so secluded and refuses to tell her anything. My problems with this book was the simplicity of it. The problem was that... there wasn\u0027t a big problem, or something with a lot of action, except for the end. One of the Blackthorne professors steals the alumni list (I don\u0027t know what that is) and they have to get it back. The Blackthorne students help out, and in the end, it turns out it was a test. Starting in the third and fourth book there\u0027s more action, but the first two felt flimsy. Also, they have all this equipment and mention so many strategies that it\u0027s so hard to figure out. I would reccomend this book, but there were a couple problems in this book that kept nagging at me. (The third and fourth book still has that factor where the equipment is so complex that it\u0027s not possible and moves so weird and ways to kill someone so impossible. I might be confusing you, but it\u0027s the best I can explain it.) The third and fourth book appealed to me a little more. �? ...more","review emma is an idiot who has absolutely no spine and she doesn\u0027t ever get one, except for the once-in-a-blue-moon occasion when her temper gets the best o emma is an idiot who has absolutely no spine and she doesn\u0027t ever get one, except for the once-in-a-blue-moon occasion when her temper gets the best of her. otherwise, she\u0027s basically a pile of jello. she NEVER stands up for herself and she basically lets her roommate jemima tramp all over her when she\u0027s obviously insulting her. and she\u0027s this people pleaser that literally NEVER stands up for herself. and she acts more like a ditzy teenager than a real working adult. i don\u0027t know if it\u0027s because of the british slang that gives me the impression (not saying that british slang is childish just that i\u0027m not used to someone actively using it in narration) or if she\u0027s really just the ditz i\u0027m making her out to be. she has sex with jack once and then all of sudden she\u0027s prattling on about how in love she is but she just sounds like a lovesick joke. she hears that jack\u0027s doing an interview on national television, but she\u0027s not allowed to go to the \"screening\" of it for whatever ridiculous reason. so instead of taking it like an adult and waiting until she gets home, she acts like a petulant child and says \"THIS IS THE MAN I LOVE! i\u0027m gonna go support him as the man i love\" it\u0027s so stupid. i can\u0027t stand her ...more","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review I\u0027m not going to spare you the full, very bitter and very negative review, and so I will make a very short one on here since I\u0027m pretty sure no one wa I\u0027m not going to spare you the full, very bitter and very negative review, and so I will make a very short one on here since I\u0027m pretty sure no one wants to read my review anyway as I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve all read it or tried to read it in the past. The good news is, I\u0027m not on a sugar rush today. I waited a full hour for it to subside before doing the necessary reviews for today. The bad news is that I really wish I had a sugar rush so I could crank this thing out really quickly and be done with it. So let\u0027s see how this goes. Okay. So Bella. How are you doing today? (This is where Bella would look to Edward for what to say) I don\u0027t want to be mean here in this review, but I just couldn\u0027t be annoyed more by how dependent Bella was with Edward. She needed him for literally EVERYTHING. If Bella wasn\u0027t with Edward, she would feel a \"hollow feeling\" in her chest. That isn\u0027t what love is, sorry. At least, not normal love where one person isn\u0027t obsessed with the other. Yes, I know love is where you can\u0027t live without your loved one, but it just seemed really bad in this case. The plot went really slow, and I felt no sympathy toward the characters. All Bella did was obsess over Edward and trip over her own feet for him. ( My knees were far too weak. To stand in your arms, without falling to your feet Set Fire to the Rain, Adele) That\u0027s exactly how Bella was toward Edward, falling to his feet and turning into absolute mush around him. The only time it got good was when Bella LEFT Edward. And then it was easier to read. ...more","review Huh. Well. I don\u0027t really have much to say as a little opener of this book other than that book. Was. Awesome! :) I loved the action and the romance a Huh. Well. I don\u0027t really have much to say as a little opener of this book other than that book. Was. Awesome! :) I loved the action and the romance and everything about this book. I think that Kristin Cashore captured the entire book so perfectly. Katsa\u0027s this perfect combination of strong yet insecure about her crazy ability, since most Graced girls usually can just cook or sew exceptionally. Katsa was the perfect witty character and at the same time a great warrior who could hold her own. We meet Po very early on in the book, and I easily get really excited, like I did when I met Po because he seems like the perfect love interest for Katsa. Then when we meet him again and we get to know him, you really can\u0027t help but love him, too. I seriously loved Po. He was a great person and super loyal and compassionate. I really loved how Po was involved in the entire plot, because sometimes the MC just goes about her business alone and doesn\u0027t really remember about the love interest until later. That didn\u0027t happen here, which I really liked. The action in here was great. Katsa learned a lot about her Grace, things that definitely weren\u0027t expected. I think that was a really interesting twist in the plot and it explained a lot of things. Everything got really intense near the end, too, and the action was great. There were some fight scenes, and other times were it was just really suspenseful, with me just sitting at the edge of my seat, trying to see what would happen next. I applaud Kristin for being able to induce that emotion in me at times. The only problem I had with the book was the ending. I usually don\u0027t like book series with each book featuring a different character, because it\u0027s just like three stand-alone, and sometimes, in fantasy, you pretty much need trilogies sometimes because there\u0027s always a bigger purpose within the books. But in this one, there wasn\u0027t, so it was basically like a standalone, and in the next book, Fire, it will feature a new character. I\u0027m a little reluctant to read it because I don\u0027t like those types of series, but I\u0027m willing to try something new. I really wish there was another book, because while I was devastated and satisfied with the ending of the book, I wanted there to be an addition to it to sort of let us know more about Katsa and Po.
