It is the goal of these Funds to enable students who rely on summer earnings to participate in unfunded nonprofit internships that they would otherwise be unable to accept. While all eligible students are encouraged to apply, preference will be given to students with demonstrated financial need.  Prospective interns may apply for full-time or part-time support; the number of students selected and the amount of support provided will ultimately depend upon the applicant pool.  Please note that we do not fund internships with for profit organizations.
