Always leave a comment explaining why you change something. If you spoke with a member of the Amarok team please mention who. If you close a bug report for 1.4.x you might want to consider using one of the following stock replies: Amarok 1.4.x is in bugfix-only mode as development is focused on Amarok 2. Unfortunately your bug will very likely not get fixed, as the risk of regressions is too high and the Amarok developers do not have the resources for it. Thank you for your report though. Please don\u0027t hesitate to report new bugs should you have any problems with Amarok 2 once it is released. And if a feature request has to be moved to Amarok 2: Amarok 1.4.x is in bugfix-only mode as development is focused on Amarok 2. Unfortunately your feature request can not be implemented in Amarok 1, as Amarok developers do not have the resources for it and risk of regression would be too high. I am therefore moving your request to Amarok 2. I cannot make any guarantee as to whether is will get implemented there or not though. Thank you for your report. And if something has already been implemented in Amarok 2: This feature is already implemented in Amarok 2.
