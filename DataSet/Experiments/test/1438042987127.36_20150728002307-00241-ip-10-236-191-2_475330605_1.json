Russell\u0027s background as an anthropologist brings history into the future when small group of human beings travel to meet some newly discovered neighbors. Funded and partially manned by the Jesuits, the story draws on what has happened in the past when one type of civilization attempted to learn without changing another - it never works out well for both groups. Told in a beginning vs the end meets in the middle manner, the story may seem to drag at the beginning, but every bit of back story is needed to reach what turns out to be an ending that doesn\u0027t seem like science fiction at all. ...more","review I expected to disappointed with this book.

Obviously, from the stars, my expectations were not met. This is a truly amazing bit of story telling. Five year old Jack tells the story of having had what he has been told is the world (a small room he shares with his mother, where everything their very life depends on the whims of someone he only knows as \"Old Nick\" very suddenly changed when they escape from what he never quite understands to have been captivity. Now there are more people than he could have ever imagined in a world that is not ran by his mother. He discovers that his window on the world, television, has been showing a real world, not a made up one, and probably worst of all, he and his mother are no longer a single unit. Through Jack\u0027s precocious language skills (which make perfect sense to me, he only had an adult to talk to, she had a laser focus on raising an intelligent child, and his father had to be reasonably intelligent to have accomplished what he did for 7 years)we see our world with very fresh eyes, eyes that might be a little quick to judge what we would have done is the same situation. ...more","review None","review Cornwell\u0027s take on the Arthurian legend is both violent and introspective.

Of course there are battles: big battles, small skirmishes, fights between two men to settle disputes, fights between entire kingdoms to settle a slight. And Cornwell knows how to write battles so that the individual cost isn\u0027t lost in the description of the vast landscapes. But he also knows how to tell the story of what is going on inside the characters heads, why they fight or don\u0027t fight, and that there are emotions beyond greed that once turned the course of history. He approaches Arthur as someone who probably was a real man in some context, that all legend has its roots in a truth of some sort, but beyond borrowing a few key players of the legend and a very broad nod at the setting, this is his take on a war lord that was a good, if flawed, man, and the people he surrounded himself with. Cornwell also brings religion into the story more than most re-tellers of this legend, and the way he plays Paganism and the new upstart Christianity against each other is not only educational, it\u0027s amusing. ...more","review I finished reading this book five days ago, and I am still thinking about what happened after the book ended.

I\u0027ve started and finished other books since then, and as I\u0027ve read them, I\u0027ve wondered how the characters of this book would have fit in to other stories. I wonder how the characters of these new books would have interacted with the Bloodworth family. How would they have fit in that tough little corner of south western Tennessee? William Gay is such a good story teller that his people and places will stay with you for a long, long time. The jacket flap of this book will lead you to believe that this is a story of a father returning and the three sons that he never connected with during the hit and miss years he did live at home. It\u0027s not that story. This is the story of the grandson, Fleming, a young man who can not catch a break. Fleming dreams of being a writer (perhaps a bit of autobiographical writing for Gay?), and most of the story is told through his eyes. He is an observer, a kid who prefers to live on the edge and observe what goes on around him. Eventually, through the absence of his own father, the return of the grandfather he never met, and the ongoing presence an amazing (and never extraneous) supporting characters, Fleming decides to go \"out among them\". The story weaves and turns, characters are introduced and then dropped, but in the end, everything is brought back together believably. There are very sad parts to the whole story (even the creepy prologue isn\u0027t there just for atmosphere). Depending on your opinion of Fleming\u0027s reaction to all that has happened to him and his family, the ending is either sad or a window opening. Either way you look at it, the story will stay with you. ...more","review When I saw that Woodrell was also the author of \"Tomato Red\", I almost put this book back on the shelf.

But the reviews for this were great, the plot sounded like an actual plot, and he\u0027s written a few more books between that one and this one, so I decided to give it a shot. And I\u0027m really glad I did! This is a tremendous story of a young girl who has lived in survival mode her entire life. Survival not only for herself, but for her two brothers and her own mother. She takes care of them not only because in her world, it\u0027s expected, but also because, as is revealed through her actions more than her words, she is a person that takes responsibility and family very seriously. It\u0027s all she has to call her own, and she will not let anyone, no matter how scary or violent and cruel, get in her way. The story moves very quickly, covering just a few days, yet there is so much character back story and revelation that it could have taken twice as many pages. The beauty of this book is that it didn\u0027t. Like the lives of the people in this story, the story is raw and to the point. ...more","review There is a line near the end of this book that will stick with me the rest of my life.

The story is told the way life flows - dragging along at times, mundane details threatening to drown us (or, in the case of McCarthy\u0027s lush descriptions, immerse us), and then something happens, a flash flood of change, whether you were ready for it or not. The book is episodic, characters dropping suddenly from sight, maybe reappearing later, maybe not. Plot lines build and then dead end with limited resolution, others read like day-in-the-lifes. People are happy and joking in one moment, a few paragraphs later and things turn incredibly dark. Like real life, there\u0027s not much foreshadowing or an all knowing narrator to hint at what\u0027s to come. There\u0027s just a man, making the best of the life he\u0027s been given. ...more","review None","review This is definitely my favorite Dresden Files book, so far.

This is due, in a major part, because my absolute favorite background character, Thomas Raith, moves very much to the forefront in this plot. But there\u0027s also a lot more going on than a good story in this book. Characters seem to be a little more fleshed out; a huge amount of canon for Harry\u0027s world is established, and there\u0027s back story for everyone. In some ways, this reads as a first book in a series, the one that not only sets the foundation for what\u0027s to come, but shows every sign of having been worked and refined by a first time author. Those are both very good surprises in a mid-series book! The plot this time may be a little more complicated than it needs to be (when your main character has to spell everything out in a long dialog with someone who\u0027s worked by his side for many years, you may have a few more twists than necessary), but the speed at which the story plays out allows the reader to just go along for the ride and enjoy the slow bits as breathing space. My only regret about this book is that with Thomas having this moment in the sun, he\u0027ll probably never be featured this much in another Dresden Files book. Ahhh, for a Thomas Raith spin off series...... ;-) ...more","review In my long life of reading, I can think of only a few books that when I finished them, I wanted to turn back to the first page and start all over agai In my long life of reading, I can think of only a few books that when I finished them, I wanted to turn back to the first page and start all over again. This book has been added to that very short list. Not only is it a coming of age story, it\u0027s also an historical fiction of Thatcher-era England, and it\u0027s the story of a young artist trying to straddle the line between assimilation and marching to his own drummer. The three themes weave together perfectly, partially because they each provide a level of conflict for our narrator/hero Jason Taylor, but also because Mitchell knows exactly when to stop being eloquent and start being funny and when to reign in the angst and provide a bit of good fortune for his character. Never once does the point of view falter, everything is seen through the eyes of a thirteen year old boy, including a friendship with a older woman. Jason, as self involved as anyone at that age, doesn\u0027t see how Mdme. Crommelynck has changed his life forever, but we, the readers, can, because Mitchell trusts his story and his writing enough to let it actions speak for themselves. That is the beauty of the whole book: there\u0027s so little telling, and so much showing. Jason\u0027s life goes by as quickly for the reader as it does for himself. ...more","review Not only is this an excellent book for writers of fiction, I\u0027d recommend it very strongly to anyone who reads or watches films with a critical eye. Vo Not only is this an excellent book for writers of fiction, I\u0027d recommend it very strongly to anyone who reads or watches films with a critical eye. Vogler relies on Joseph Campbell\u0027s explorations into myths and why humans need them to build a classic story telling formula that works. How do we know it works? He\u0027s got example after example, and honestly, it\u0027s hard to argue with the success of The Wizard of Oz, Titanic, the Indiana Jones\u0027 franchise, etc as successful story telling. Certainly, books aren\u0027t quite the same as film, but there\u0027s enough similarity that Vogler\u0027s book will help many writers find what\u0027s missing in their plot or their characters. As for the critical eye, if you\u0027ve ever wondered why films like the first Pirates of the Caribbean worked so well and the second one didn\u0027t, or what went wrong with Wolfgang Peterson\u0027s Troy (films released long after this book was written, but perfect examples of the type of film Vogler knows best), this book will give you some insight into what might have been missing. As a reader, you\u0027ll also be see what causes the difference between a good story/character arc and a great one. And finally, if nothing else, this book flat out admits that scriptwriters that work for Disney will have their story tweeked to fit a template of what has worked best for Disney in the past. ...more","review Very funny, very intelligent and very original!

The body he is given as his instrument of redemption belongs to a writer, and that inspires Lucifer to use the time to tell his version of Creation, Adam and Eve and original sin, Jesus Christ (or Junior or Jimminy Christmas or a bunch of other nick names the Devil uses for the guy who got in the way of Hell being a capacity crowd), and a lot of other things that we mortals haven\u0027t gotten quite the truth about, in his opinion. With the power of clairvoyance, it\u0027s quite easy to gather an entourage of just the type of people we\u0027ve all suspected were one step removed from the dark one - commercial film makers and their ilk. Underneath Lucifer\u0027s manipulations, there\u0027s a surprising sweet story of how the Angels (fallen and un-fallen) are similar to a lot of big families where the father reigns supreme. When that subplot turns into a very satisfying ending, you know you\u0027ve read a story by an author who wasn\u0027t afraid to go full out. ...more","review Audiobook read by Michael Maloney) - This is one book that is going to stay with me for quite awhile.

It\u0027s not very long, but it packs an emotional wallop. At the center of the story is Bruno, a nine year old boy adjusting to his family relocating for his father\u0027s new job. Many critics and blurbs for this book think that to mention anything more specific spoils what is supposed to be a slow reveal of where Bruno is living, but honestly, if you don\u0027t guess the location and what his father\u0027s job is when the boy first mispronounces the name, you\u0027re just not paying attention. Michael Maloney\u0027s reading of the story put me off at first, sounding as if this were a child\u0027s story rather than a story from a child\u0027s point of view, but once the implications of what Bruno and his family are a part of, that voice is all that keeps you hoping for a happy ending. ...more","review This is the story of a young man falling in love for the first time, with all the pain and passion and joy that can only happen that first time, when This is the story of a young man falling in love for the first time, with all the pain and passion and joy that can only happen that first time, when everything seems possible. It\u0027s a \"that one special summer\" that we all dreamed about having when we were young, with all the negatives that we didn\u0027t know about until we were not so young. Beautiful setting, beautiful language. ...more","review None","review - Set in the story of how a man can become what people expect him to be, and how it becomes easier to disappear rather than fight the expectations. Th - Set in the story of how a man can become what people expect him to be, and how it becomes easier to disappear rather than fight the expectations. This is a story of race (set in the early days of the Civil Rights movement, right after WWI), but it\u0027s still a very current theme - how people are judged and feared because they look different or act different, and the distances they will go to be accepted, even to the point of becoming someone they never were. ...more","review What can I say?

To say that it\u0027s about an artist\u0027s journey to understanding himself is a gross understatement, to say it\u0027s about a friendship of souls isn\u0027t enough, and to say that it\u0027s a parable of the spiritual vs. the physical doesn\u0027t cover it either.

That\u0027s my problem with this book - I love the story and characters so much, I probably can\u0027t look at the execution as a seperate concept. I also can\u0027t say much without giving away the perfect twists and turns Purdy wrote into this of three (or four, depending how you read it) lives cross over and over to form a web of love and broken hearts. Garnet Montrose is only the most haunting of these characters - they all are enduring creations. ...more","review Once upon a time, I was like so many other readers who could not wait for the next Steven King book to be published. But over time, it seemed to me th Once upon a time, I was like so many other readers who could not wait for the next Steven King book to be published. But over time, it seemed to me that the books got longer for no literary reason. They just weren\u0027t that good, imo. However, I can not deny that as a writer, Steven King understands that it\u0027s all about putting your butt in the chair and working. This book serves two purposes, it\u0027s autobiographic and a writer\u0027s manual. In the tell-all portions, Mr. King talks about his journey to the pinacle of bestsellerdom and the demons he brought with him. The \"this is how you do it section\" is nothing fancy but they\u0027re all words any writer needs to hear, over and over again. ...more"],["notes","notes Notes are private!","notes Notes are
