Ce roman fait découvrir toute une série de personnages pas comme les autres, et forcément attachants, comme monsieur Hamil qui est ami avec Victor Hugo et le confond avec le Coran parfois, madame Lola qui est un travesti ancien champion de boxe au Sénégal, avec des gros seins, qui aurait fait une mère parfaite si elle avait eu le matériel, le docteur Katz avec toute son affection pour Momo, et puis bien sûr, Momo et Madame Rosa, qui sont tout l\u0027un pour l\u0027autre. On s\u0027attache d\u0027abord à Momo, à son univers, puis à madame Rosa, la fin est très émouvante. \" - J\u0027avais peur que tu me quittes, Momo, alors je t\u0027ai un peu diminué.
