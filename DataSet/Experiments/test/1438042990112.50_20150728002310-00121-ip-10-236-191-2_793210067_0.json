Some of the bigger unclimbed cliffs would require even longer ropes. The island has been uninhabited since 1912 and is now owned by the National Trust. There is a good camping area next to the National Trust building above the bay on the east side of the island. The island can be accessed privately by boat. Access notes Although plenty of lower grade climbs do exist, it is generally recommended to be leading or at least pushing E2 in order to access the best of the place. Along with its neighbouring islands, this is one of the best rock climbing destinations in Britain, as well as one of the most remote.
