The aim of this bug day is to clear as many Amarok bugs as possible. Our target for triage is bugs listed in bugs.kde.org under the product Amarok. The goal of this bug-day is to check for bugs that are fixed, duplicates, are not going to be fixed in Amarok 1.4.x or are already fixed/implemented in Amarok 2. This will enable the Amarok developers to deal with bugs more easily, and so have more time left to actually code on Amarok 2. When you have closed or commented on a bug, please list it in the appropriate section below, so that a second triager can see if they can confirm it. Be sure to join #kde-bugs on irc.freenode.net, as this is where the bug-day will be coordinated. Amarok team members will be both there and in #amarok to answer your questions. If none of them are around please note the bug in the list below so they can be dealt with later. You should be working with Amarok 1.4.9.1 and Amarok 2 for testing these bugs. To make it easier for you to obtain Amarok 2 we provide nightly builds of it. So far Packages for Kubuntu and openSUSE are available. For more information check out the Neon wiki page. For openSUSE packages","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":0,"headerRowIndex":0}
