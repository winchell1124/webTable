This critical success begs the question: Just how many millions will the Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio film make? The Wolf of Wall Street has hit American theaters and viewers are raving. The New York Times calls it a \"vital and troubling document of the present,\" and Rolling Stone says director Martin Scorsese \"tells the truth about America,\" something few blockbusters are able to do. According to Time Warner\u0027s  (NYSE: TWX  ) Rotten Tomatoes, 75% of critics and 81% of audience members like it, placing the movie at the top of the heap of Christmas Day releases.

On average, each of these movies has done well at the box office, generating $394 million in revenue, more than four times their initial budget. In terms of \u0027Dollar Per DiCaprio,\u0027 which measures a film studio\u0027s initial return on Leonardo DiCaprio\u0027s upfront salary, the results have been equally as profitable. Recent standouts include Inception and J. Edgar, where the actor reportedly agreed to take significant pay cuts to his upfront salary. Clearly, Leo is one of today\u0027s most bankable movie stars. According to Forbes, Hollywood\u0027s best values typically generate $20 to $40 in revenue for every dollar of salary received, and most of DiCaprio\u0027s projects fall near this range. More importantly, though, none of the movies he\u0027s starred in since Titanic have flopped, and only The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and Body of Lies have failed to make back at least twice their budget.
