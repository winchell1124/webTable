Without adjusting for inflation, this is higher than the first 22 James Bond films and the six films in the Star Wars franchise.[122] Chris Columbus\u0027s Philosopher\u0027s Stone became the highest-grossing Harry Potter film worldwide upon completing its theatrical run in 2002, but it was eventually topped by David Yates\u0027s Deathly Hallows �? Part 2, while Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least.[123][124][125][126], 19776\u003dHeyman\u0027s enthusiasm led to Rowling\u0027s 1999 sale of the film rights for the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported £1 million (US$2,000,000).[11] A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, allowing nevertheless for the inclusion of many Irish actors, such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such.[12] Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \"didn\u0027t want to give them control over the rest of the story\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.[13], 55409\u003dBecause the films were being made as the novels were being published, the filmmakers had no idea of the story\u0027s outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his relationship with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, \"The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, \u0027I know the movies can\u0027t be the books... because I know what\u0027s coming and it\u0027s impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I\u0027m going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that\u0027s all I care about.\u0027\"[46] Kloves also said, \"I don\u0027t know what compelled me to say this [to Rowling], but I said, \u0027I\u0027ve just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.\u0027 And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me.\"[46], 76421\u003dIn January 2010, Alexandre Desplat was confirmed to compose the score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows �? Part 1.[63] The film\u0027s orchestration started in the summer with Conrad Pope, the orchestrator on the first three Harry Potter films, collaborating with Desplat. Pope commented that the music \"reminds one of the old days.\"[64] Desplat returned to score Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows �? Part 2 in 2011.[65], 29348\u003dIn 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor Daniel Radcliffe was discovered by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a theatre. In Heyman\u0027s own words, \"There sitting behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe. I remember my first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic. There was real generosity too, and sweetness. But at the same time he was really voracious and with hunger for knowledge of whatever kind.\" [10], 144998\u003dOn 12 September 2013, Warner Bros. announced that J.K. Rowling was writing a script based on her book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and the adventures of its fictional author Newt Scamander, set 70 years before the adventures of Harry Potter. The film would mark Rowling\u0027s screenwriting debut and is planned as the first movie in a new series.[148] According to Rowling, after Warner Bros. came suggesting an adaptation, she wrote a rough draft of the script in 12 days. She said, \"It wasn\u0027t a great draft but it did show the shape of how it might look. So that is how it all started.\"[149] On 29 March 2014, The New York Times reported that a trilogy is scheduled and the film will begin in New York.[150], 97933\u003dThe final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was split into two cinematic parts: Part 1 was released on 19 November 2010, and Part 2, the conclusion to both the final film and the series, was released on 15 July 2011.[74] Part 1 was originally scheduled to be released in 3D and 2D,[75] but due to a delay in the 3D conversion process, Warner Bros. released the film only in 2D and IMAX cinemas. However, Part 2 was released in 2D and 3D cinemas as originally planned.[76], 107850\u003dAt the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011, J. K. Rowling, David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema for the series.[102][103], 27070\u003dWarner Bros. had initially planned to release the first film over the 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several of the originally proposed directors had withdrawn themselves from contention. Eventually, due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.[25], 32893\u003dFilming of the series began at Leavesden Studios, Hertfordshire, England, in September 2000 and ended in December 2010, with post-production on the final film lasting until summer 2011.[6] Leavesden Studios was the main base for filming Harry Potter, and it opened to the public as a studio tour in 2012 (renamed as Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden).[29], 80921\u003dOn 12 June 2010, filming of the Deathly Hallows �? Part 1 and Deathly Hallows �? Part 2 was completed with actor Warwick Davis stating on his Twitter account, \"The end of an Era �? today is officially the last day of principal photography on \u0027Harry Potter\u0027 �? ever. I feel honoured to be here as the director shouts cut for the very last time. Farewell Harry \u0026 Hogwarts, it\u0027s been magic!\".[70] However, reshoots of the epilogue scene were confirmed to begin in the winter of 2010. The filming was completed on 21 December 2010, marking the official closure of filming the Harry Potter franchise.[71] Exactly four years earlier on that day, author J. K. Rowling\u0027s official website revealed the title of the final novel in the series �? Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[72], 41444\u003dHeyday Films and Columbus\u0027s company 1492 Pictures collaborated with Duncan Henderson Productions in 2001, Miracle Productions in 2002, and P of A Productions in 2004. Even though Prisoner of Azkaban was the final film produced by 1492 Pictures, Heyday Films continued with the franchise and collaborated with Patalex IV Productions in 2005. The sixth film in the series, Half-Blood Prince, was the most expensive film to produce as of 2009., 146231\u003dOn 13 May 2014, Warner Bros. announced that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them would be released on 18 November 2016.[151], 77612\u003dDirector David Yates stated that he wanted John Williams to return to the series for the final instalment, but their schedules did not align due to the urgent demand of a rough cut of the film sooner than was possible.[66] The final recording sessions of Harry Potter took place on 27 May 2011 at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra, orchestrator Conrad Pope, and composer Alexandre Desplat.[67], 30081\u003dRadcliffe had already established himself as an actor in the 1999 BBC television production of David Copperfield in which he played the title role\u0027s childhood years. Heyman convinced Radcliffe\u0027s parents to allow him to audition for the part of Harry Potter, which involved Radcliffe being filmed.[10] (This screen test footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in 2009.)[26] Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe\u0027s filmed test, saying she didn\u0027t think there was a better choice for the part of Harry Potter.[10][27], 96346\u003dThe rights for the first four novels in the series were sold to Warner Bros. for £1,000,000 by J.K. Rowling. After the release of the fourth book in July 2000, the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone, was released on 16 November 2001. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $90 million in the United States alone, which set a record opening worldwide. The succeeding three motion picture adaptations followed suit in financial success, while garnering positive reviews from fans and critics. The fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released by Warner Bros. on 11 July 2007 in English-speaking countries, except for the UK and Ireland, which released the movie on 12 July.[73] The sixth, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 15 July 2009 to critical acclaim and finished its theatrical run ranked as the number two grossing film of 2009 on the worldwide charts., 18896\u003dLate in 1997, film producer David Heyman\u0027s London offices received a copy of the first book in what would become Rowling\u0027s series of seven Harry Potter novels. The book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone, was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review. Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \"the rubbish title\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling\u0027s work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time.[10], 75329\u003dAfter Williams left the series to pursue other projects, Patrick Doyle scored the fourth entry, Goblet of Fire, which was directed by Mike Newell, with whom Doyle had worked previously. In 2006, Nicholas Hooper started work on the soundtrack to Order of the Phoenix by reuniting with old friend director David Yates. Hooper also composed the soundtrack to Half-Blood Prince but decided not to return for the final films., 41967\u003dWarner Bros. split the seventh and final novel in the series, Deathly Hallows, into two cinematic parts. The two parts were filmed back-to-back from early 2009 to summer 2010, with the completion of reshoots taking place on 21 December 2010; this marked the end of filming Harry Potter. Heyman stated that Deathly Hallows was \"shot as one film\" but released in two feature-length parts.[31], 56905\u003dAside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall. Richard Harris, who played the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore, died on 25 October 2002 causing the role to be re-cast for the third instalment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. David Heyman and director Alfonso Cuarón chose Michael Gambon to portray the character of Dumbledore, which he did for all succeeding films. Notable recurring cast members include Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley., 31427\u003dAlso in 2000, the then unknown British actors Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were selected from thousands of auditioning children to play the roles of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, respectively. Their only previous acting experience was in school plays. Grint was eleven years old and Watson ten at the time they were cast.[28], 109107\u003dIn addition, the American Film Institute recognized the entire series with a Special Award at the American Film Institute Awards in 2011.

However, the series did not win any. Some critics, fans, and general audiences have expressed disappointment that the series has not captured any Oscars for its achievements. However, detractors have pointed that certain films in the series have had uneven reviews, in contrast to the three films of The Lord of the Rings, which were all critically acclaimed. This has been partially attributed to the Harry Potter franchise going through several directors with their own styles, something that the Academy reportedly does not favor, in contrast to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which was filmed in one massive undertaking by the same director, writer, and producer.[107][108] Although not successful at the Oscars, the Harry Potter series has gained success in many other award ceremonies, including the annual Saturn Awards and Art Directors Guild Awards.
