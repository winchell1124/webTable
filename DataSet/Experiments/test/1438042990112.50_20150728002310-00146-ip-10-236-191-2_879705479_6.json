Scrolling in folder views does not lag anymore, and the desktop switching window-shuffle animation is silky smooth whereas before it would hiccup.","huge. Plasma is now actually usable (was very painful before). KWin is also very smooth now.","Huge difference, saved my day.","Huge! No kwin hangups anymore (like with 173.xx). Runs nicely with effects enabled. I also followed the instructions on the nvidia-forums [1].","It runs much better with this driver, IPP helps a lot for this too.","Not that much of a difference, as 2D was already good with the xorg.conf options listed above. A nVidia employee recently wrote that the XRender / KDE4 issues are being addressed right now and should be fixed in the 177 final release. Please be patient.","Window resizing is finally possible. Scrolling still choppy, but much better (you wouldn\u0027t believe how much it sucked before)...","Huge.","Fixed the resizing issue, scrolling in folders is a lot more smoother. However, every once in a while, minimizing/maximizing grinds to a total halt (framerate drops to 0); after couple seconds, everything is back to normal. Apart from this big annoyance, everything is perfect (framerate stays between 40 and 60 no matter what i do).","Huge. Please note that I\u0027m running an TwinView Setup (2 DFP).","Huge. Desktop switching, scrolling and konsole work smooth.","For me it was adding \"options nvidia NVreg_RegistryDwords\u003d\"PerfLevelSrc\u003d0x2222\"\" \"options nvidia NVreg_Mobile\u003d1\" to /etc/modprobe.conf which did the trick. It sets the powerlevel of the card to always 2.","Finally! I can actually use KDE4! Note that IPP\u003d2 is MUCH worse for me than IPP\u003d1.","Upgrading to 177.80 did nothing to me. Only setting the InitialPixmapPlacement\u003d2 made konsole resize normally. So 177.80 is not a fix, or maybe not for my card?","Still having konsole resize issue with 180.60 version. Setting the InitialPixmapPlacement\u003d2 solves that.","Noticed major slowdown on the 177.80 driver. After running the nvida-settings command, noticed major improvements all round. Previously was experiencing slowdown on switching apps etc (CTRL+F10 and the like) and the folder view plasmoid was very near unusable. Updated settings had drastically improved performance.","Also noticed a slowdown with IPP\u003d2 on the 177.80.

Please post your experiences to the table below: [edit] Experiences Canvas can also be tested at http://blobsallad.se/ http://intertwingly.net/stories/2006/07/10/penroseTiling.html After making the above changes, you can use the Canvas speed test benchmark below to test and see if it did affect performance. Run the Canvas test with InitialPixmapPlacement\u003d1 and InitialPixmapPlacement\u003d2 to see the difference in time taken. (Note: It may not work with Konqueror, try using Firefox 3) [edit] Benchmarking Changes They should speed up things as well, be careful with BackingStore though, it might be possible that kwin will crash for you, see \"Known Problems\" below. You might want to try other, higher values for PixmapCacheSize.

With BackingStore set to 1 in xorg.conf it may be possible that the KDE session crashes on startup (kdm works but kwin does not). Following those steps with cards from the 7xxx series is said to increase GPU temperature a lot.

The Yakuake terminal has scrolling problems after these changes, it also takes long to appear / disappear, regardless of the animation speed you set.   Warning I do not suggest running BETA quality software (especially drivers) on any system.
