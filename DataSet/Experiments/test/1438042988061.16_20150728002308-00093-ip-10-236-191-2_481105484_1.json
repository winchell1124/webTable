It has an orphan, a rich man, a crazy hidden wife, and enough secrets for anyone to handle. It\u0027s like the best soap opera all boxed up in several hundred pages. I can\u0027t even begin to describe how amazing this book is. It begins with an orphan who is terribly treated by an aunt who doesn\u0027t love her, sent to live in a boarding school so strict she barely eats, and ends up governing a silly little girl who happens to be a relative of an extremely handsome older man. I\u0027m not telling you more, so READ IT. ...more","review This is one of the most humourous and romantic books of all time.

I recommend reading this and then following it with some of his short stories or a novel. ...more","review Really, this is a rare book that \"made my life better\".

I think Marilynne Robinson is amazing because she has written two novels in the past twenty years (that have been published) and both have been amazing. This is story of 2 girls who struggle to live with various members of their family after their depressed mother leaves them. It\u0027s hard to put into words the depth of emotion that comes out of Robinson\u0027s beautiful prose, and to fully comprehend everything that is going on in the story. What i can say is that it is one of those books that leaves you feeling contented when you finish, as if you are okay with where the characters are left. I highly, highly recommend reading this. If you were an English Lit person in college, you should have read it then, but if you haven\u0027t, you should probably head to the library sometime in the very near future and pick up a copy. ...more","review Okay, so after reading this I spent about the next ten years begging for a Chincoteague Pony.

It\u0027s still on my list of things to do- go see the round-up and auction. I laughed, I cried, and I wanted more. I was also like eight years old. This book and its corresponding series, is a classic. Really. Classic. You should read it. And then you\u0027ll probably want a pony too. ...more","review I LOVED THIS BOOK.

Really, it\u0027s one of the best memoirs I\u0027ve read in a long time. I felt like I was just sitting on a couch listening to Mildred tell me about her childhood during the Great Depression. Essentially here\u0027s a synopsis- when she is five, she is sent with her three siblings to live with her grandparents on their farm in Iowa. Pretty much unaware of what\u0027s going on with the economy, Millie is taught self-perseverance, how to cook all kinds of things, and generally survive in a thrifty manner. It made me want to conserve. I wonder how much better off our world would be if we treated each resource as precious. Her family definitely did. She spoke a lot about reusing everything over and over. There are also a ton of great stories about farming, and you learn a bunch of great skills- how to wean a calf, berry pickin\u0027, taming raccoons and curing almost any ailment without a doctor. It\u0027s great to read about this, and know that it wasn\u0027t so long ago that this was how people lived- little electricity, no running water, no phone, no TV. I am completely obsessed with this book now. Maybe I\u0027ll go live on a farm. ...more","review You should read this if you are a woman, if you are pro-life or if you are pro-choice.

You should read this if you are passive about the survival of the right to choose. You should read this if you are alive, if you believe in the right to the pursuit of happiness. I couldn\u0027t believe everything I learned from reading this. There are so many facets to the issue that I never considered. Like the 24hour waiting period. I thought this was a good thing, that people should wait to make a decision like this. And she stressed that it could be, but not if you were poor, had one day off of work and had just driven 300 miles to have this procedure done because that was the nearest place to have it done. Or, how about 85% of abortions are NOT PERFORMED IN HOSPITALS? I had no clue that most hospitals won\u0027t perform them, instead referring patients to clinics. And naturally your insurance, which will cover gastric by-pass surgery, will not cover your abortion. Meaning you pay out of pocket. I\u0027m not going to keep going on and on but this is a book you should read, especially during an election year. ...more","review Hilarious!!","review Seriously, amazing.
