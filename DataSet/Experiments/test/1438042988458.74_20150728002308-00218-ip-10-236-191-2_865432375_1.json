In July 2003, he appeared in Series 02 (Episode 09) of Top Gear in the Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car segment, achieving a time of 1:50 in the Liana. In 2005, he was cast as Professor Ian Hood in an ITV thriller 4-episode series Eleventh Hour, created by Stephen Gallagher. The first episode was broadcast on 19 January 2006. He also, in 2005, played Captain Nemo in a two-part adaptation of The Mysterious Island. Stewart also appeared as a nudity obsessed caricature of himself in Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant\u0027s television series Extras., 11053\u003dStewart grew up in a poor household with domestic violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs.[8] He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow.[9] Stewart\u0027s father served with the King\u0027s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was Regimental Sergeant Major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman.[10] As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, \"My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realized how my father inserted himself into my work. I\u0027ve grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn\u0027t have one, but when I looked in the mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father\u0027s face staring straight back at me.\"[11], 42657\u003dAfter The Next Generation began, Stewart soon found that he missed acting on the stage.[26] Although he remained associated with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the lengthy filming for the series had prevented him from participating in most other works, leaving a \"gaping hole\" of many years in his CV as a Shakespearean actor and causing him to miss opportunities to play such notable roles as Hamlet, Romeo, and Richard III.[26][25] Instead, Stewart began writing one-man shows that he performed in California universities and acting schools. One of these—a version of Charles Dickens\u0027s A Christmas Carol in which he portrayed all 40-plus characters—became ideal for him as an actor as well, because of its limited performing schedule.[39] In 1991, Stewart performed it on Broadway,[26] receiving a nomination for that year\u0027s Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show.[40] He staged encore performances in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, again for the benefit of survivors and victims\u0027 families in the 11 September attacks, and a 23-day run in London\u0027s West End in December 2005. For his performances in this play, Stewart has received the Drama Desk Award for Best Solo Performance in 1992 and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment for Solo Performance in 1994. He was also the co-producer of the show, through the company he set up for the purpose: Camm Lane Productions, a reference to his birthplace in Camm Lane, Mirfield., 74056\u003dIn 2008, Stewart began dating Sunny Ozell, a singer and songwriter based in Brooklyn, New York, whom Stewart met while performing in Macbeth at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.[67] Stewart purchased a home in Park Slope, Brooklyn, in August 2012,[68] and subsequently began living there with Ozell.[67] In March 2013, it was reported that Stewart and Ozell were engaged,[67] and they married in September 2013, Ian McKellen performing the wedding ceremony.[67][69], 49700\u003dHe played Antony again opposite Harriet Walter\u0027s Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra at the Novello Theatre in London in 2007 to excellent reviews.[25] During this period, Stewart also addressed the Durham Union Society on his life in film and theatre. When Stewart began playing Macbeth in the West End in 2007, some said that he was too old for the role; he and the show again received excellent reviews, with one critic calling Stewart \"one of our finest Shakespearean actors\".[26][25] He was named as the next Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre based at St Catherine\u0027s College, Oxford in January 2007.[44] In 2008, Stewart played King Claudius in Hamlet alongside David Tennant. He won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actor for the part. When collecting his award, he dedicated the award \"in part\" to Tennant and Tennant\u0027s understudy Edward Bennett, after Tennant\u0027s back injury and subsequent absence from four weeks of Hamlet disqualified him from an Olivier nomination.[45], 47457\u003dShakespeare roles during this period included Prospero in Shakespeare\u0027s The Tempest, on Broadway in 1995, a role he would reprise in Rupert Goold\u0027s 2006 production of The Tempest as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company\u0027s Complete Works Festival.[41] In 1997, he took the role of Othello with the Shakespeare Theatre Company (Washington, D.C.) in a race-bending performance, in a \"photo negative\" production of a white Othello with an otherwise all-black cast. Stewart had wanted to play the title role since the age of 14, so he and director Jude Kelly inverted the play so Othello became a comment on a white man entering a black society.[42][43], 27665\u003dStewart unexpectedly became wealthy because of the show\u0027s great success.[26] In 1992, during a break in filming, Stewart calculated that he earned more during that break than from 10 weeks of Woolf in London.[23] From 1994 to 2002, he also portrayed Picard in the films Star Trek Generations (1994), Star Trek: First Contact (1996), Star Trek: Insurrection (1998) and Star Trek: Nemesis (2002); and in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\u0027s pilot episode \"Emissary\", and received a 1995 Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for \"Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series\"., 84226\u003dIn July 2012, Stewart carried the Olympic torch as part of the official relay for the 2012 Summer Olympics[89] and stated it was an experience he will \u0027never forget\u0027, adding that it was better than any movie première., 21313\u003dWhile not wealthy, Stewart had a comfortable lifestyle as an actor; he found that despite a lengthy career, his reputation was not great enough to bring a production of Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? to a West End theatre. Stewart thus in 1987 agreed to work in Hollywood, after Robert H. Justman, a producer working on Star Trek: The Next Generation, saw him while attending a literary reading at UCLA.[23][24] Stewart knew nothing about the original show, Star Trek, or its iconic status in American culture. He was reluctant to sign the standard contract of six years but did so as he, his agent, and others Stewart consulted with, all believed that the new show would quickly fail and he would return to his London stage career after making some money.[25][26][27][28], 71643\u003dStewart and his first wife Sheila Falconer divorced in 1990 after 24 years of marriage.[62][63] They have two children together, son Daniel and daughter Sophia.[63] Daniel is a television actor,[64] and has appeared alongside his father in the 1993 made-for-television film Death Train, and the 1992 Star Trek episode \"The Inner Light\", playing his son.[n 1], 3889\u003dSir Patrick Stewart OBE (born 13 July 1940) is an English film, television, and stage actor, who has had a distinguished career on stage and screen. He is most widely known for his roles as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation and its successor films, as Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men film series of superhero movies (2000�?2014), his prolific stage roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and his many voice acting roles, most notably as CIA deputy director Avery Bullock in American Dad!., 82868\u003dStewart was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 New Year Honours list,[84] and was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to drama.[85][86], 38949\u003dStewart\u0027s other film and television roles include the flamboyantly gay Sterling in the 1995 film Jeffrey and King Henry II in The Lion in Winter, for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his performance and an Emmy Award nomination for executive-producing the film. He portrayed Captain Ahab in the 1998 made-for-television film version of Moby Dick, receiving Emmy Award[38] and Golden Globe Award nominations for his performance. He also starred as Scrooge in a 1999 television film version of Charles Dickens\u0027 A Christmas Carol, receiving a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for his performance., 79361\u003dStewart is president of Huddersfield Town Academy, the local football club\u0027s project for identifying and developing young talent. He is a lifelong supporter of the club.[79] In an interview with American Theatre, he stated that \"From time to time, I have fantasies of becoming a concert pianist. I\u0027ve been lucky enough through the years to work very closely with the great Emanuel Ax. I\u0027ve said to him that if I could switch places with anyone it would be with him.\"[11] Stewart is also an avid car enthusiast; he is regularly seen at Silverstone during British Grand Prix weekends, and on a 2003 appearance on Top Gear set a lap time of 1 min 50 secs on the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" feature. He holds an MSA Competition Licence and competed in the 2012 Silverstone Classic Celebrity Challenge race finishing ninth, 3m02.808s behind winner Kelvin Fletcher.[80] During 2012, Stewart met his racing hero Stirling Moss for the BBC Two documentary Racing Legends.[81], 14142\u003dStewart attended Crowlees Church of England Junior and Infants School.[13] He attributes his acting career to an English teacher named Cecil Dormand who \"put a copy of Shakespeare in my hand [and] said, \u0027Now get up on your feet and perform.\u0027\"[14] In 1951, aged 11, he entered Mirfield Secondary Modern School,[15] where he continued to study drama. At age 15, Stewart left school and increased his participation in local theatre. He acquired a job as a newspaper reporter and obituary writer at the Mirfield \u0026 District Reporter,[16] but after a year, his employer gave him an ultimatum to choose acting or journalism.[17] He quit the job. His brother tells the story that Stewart would attend rehearsals during work time and then invent the stories he reported. Stewart also trained as a boxer.[16] He lost his hair at the age of 18. The traumatic experience made Stewart timid, and he found that acting served as a means of self-expression.[18], 83722\u003dIn July 2011, Stewart received an Honorary Doctorate of Letters (Hon.Litt.D.) from the University of East Anglia.[87][88], 73534\u003dFour months before his divorce from Neuss, Stewart played opposite actress Lisa Dillon in a production of The Master Builder, and the two were romantically involved until 2007.[65][66], 5123\u003dIn 1993, TV Guide named him the best dramatic television actor of the 1980s.[1], 72910\u003dIn 1997, Stewart became engaged to Wendy Neuss, one of the producers of Star Trek: The Next Generation. They married on 25 August 2000, and divorced three years later.[62][n 2][63], 68499\u003dStewart supports the Armed Forces charity Combat Stress, after learning about his father\u0027s post-traumatic stress disorder when researching his family genealogy for the documentary series Who Do You Think You Are?.[59] He is Patron of the United Nations Association �? UK, and delivered a speech at UNA-UK\u0027s UN Forum 2012 on Saturday 14 July 2012,[60] speaking of his father\u0027s experiences in World War Two, and how he believed that the UN was the best legacy of that period.[61], 66016\u003dHe voiced the narrator of the Electronic Arts computer game, The Sims Medieval, for the game\u0027s introduction cinematic and trailer released on 22 March 2011.[53] He also voiced the story plaques and trailer of the MMOG LEGO Universe., 59886\u003dHe played a recurring role as CIA Deputy Director Avery Bullock, lending his likeness as well as his voice on the animated series American Dad!. He has made (as of 6 August 2011) nine guest appearances on Family Guy in various roles: first in \"Peter\u0027s Got Woods\", second in \"No Meals on Wheels\" when Peter likens something to when he once swapped voices with him for a day, third in \"Lois Kills Stewie\" as his American Dad! character Bullock, fourth in \"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\" as himself, fifth in \"And Then There Were Fewer\" as a cat that proclaims himself a professor, sixth in \"Halloween on Spooner Street\" as Dick Pump, seventh in \"The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair\" as Susie Swanson and eighth in the DVD version of It\u0027s A Trap! as Captain Picard.

In the same year, he gave his name to a scholarship at the University of Huddersfield, where he is Chancellor, to fund post-graduate study into domestic violence.[55][56] Stewart\u0027s childhood experience also led him to become a patron of Refuge, a UK charity for abused women.[57] In October 2011, he presented a BBC Lifeline Appeal on behalf of Refuge, discussing his own experience of domestic violence and interviewing a woman whose daughter was murdered by her ex-husband.[58], 63162\u003dIn addition to voicing his characters from Star Trek and X-Men in several related computer and video games, Stewart worked as a voice actor on games unrelated to both franchises, such as Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone, Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion for which in 2006 he won a Spike TV Video Game Award for his work as Emperor Uriel Septim.

On being questioned about the significance of his role compared to his distinguished Shakespearean career, Stewart has said that: \"The fact is all of those years in Royal Shakespeare Company �? playing all those kings, emperors, princes and tragic heroes �? were nothing but preparation for sitting in the captain\u0027s chair of the Enterprise.\"[31] The accolades Stewart has received include the readers of TV Guide in 1992 choosing him with Cindy Crawford, of whom he had never heard, as television\u0027s \"most bodacious\" man and woman.[12][32][18] In an interview with Michael Parkinson, he expressed gratitude for Gene Roddenberry\u0027s riposte to a reporter who said, \"Surely they would have cured baldness by the 24th century,\" to which Roddenberry replied, \"In the 24th century, they wouldn\u0027t care.\"[33][34], 57403\u003dHe also was a voice actor on the animated films The Prince of Egypt, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, Chicken Little, The Pagemaster, and on the English dubbings of the Japanese anime films Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind by Hayao Miyazaki and Steamboy. He supported his home town of Dewsbury in West Yorkshire by lending his voice to a series of videos on the town in 1999. He voiced the pig Napoleon in a TV adaptation of George Orwell\u0027s Animal Farm and guest starred in the Simpsons episode \"Homer the Great\" as Number One. Patrick also narrated the prologue and epilogue for Disney\u0027s The Nightmare Before Christmas, which also appears on the film\u0027s soundtrack. He was originally going to do the voice for Jafar in Aladdin, but couldn\u0027t finish due to scheduling conflicts with Star Trek: The Next Generation. He has since called this the biggest regret of his career in interviews.[51], 81953\u003dHaving lived in Los Angeles for many years, Stewart moved back to England in 2004, in part to return to work in the theatre.[8] In the same year, Stewart was appointed Chancellor[82] of the University of Huddersfield and subsequently as a Professor of Performing Arts in July 2008.

Currently, he is heard during National Car Rental television spots., 37327\u003dIn 2011, Stewart appeared in the feature-length documentary The Captains alongside William Shatner (who played Star Trek Captain James Kirk) �? Shatner also wrote and directed the film. In the film, Shatner interviews actors who have portrayed captains within the Star Trek franchise. The film pays a great deal of attention to Shatner\u0027s interviews with Stewart at his home in Oxfordshire as well as at a Star Trek Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada; Stewart reveals the fear and personal failings that came along with his tenure as a Starfleet captain, but also the great triumphs he believes accompanied his role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard.[37], 16923\u003dFollowing a period with Manchester\u0027s Library Theatre, he became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1966, remaining with them until 1982. He was an Associate Artist of the company in 1968.[19] He appeared with actors such as Ben Kingsley and Ian Richardson. In January 1967, he made his debut TV appearance on Coronation Street as a Fire Officer. In 1969, he had a brief TV cameo role as Horatio, opposite Ian Richardson\u0027s Hamlet, in a performance of the gravedigger scene as part of episode six of Sir Kenneth Clark\u0027s Civilisation television series.[20] He made his Broadway debut as Snout in Peter Brook\u0027s legendary[21] production of A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream, then moved to the Royal National Theatre in the early 1980s.

He appeared as Vladimir Lenin in Fall of Eagles; Sejanus in I, Claudius;[22] Karla in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley\u0027s People; Claudius in a 1980 BBC adaptation of Hamlet. He even took the romantic male lead in the 1975 BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell\u0027s North and South (wearing a hairpiece).

Stewart had previously appeared only once alongside McKellen on stage, but the pair had developed a close friendship while waiting around on set filming the X-Men films.[46] Stewart stated that performing in this play was the fulfilment of a 50-year ambition, having seen Peter O\u0027Toole appear in it at the Bristol Old Vic while Stewart was just 17.[46] Reviewers stated that his interpretation captured well the balance between humour and despair that characterises the work.[47] Stewart has also expressed interest in appearing in Doctor Who.[48], 76140\u003dStewart\u0027s politics are rooted in his belief in fairness and equality.[8] He considers himself a socialist and is a member of the Labour Party.[70][71][18] He stated, \"My father was a very strong trade unionist and those fundamental issues of Labour were ingrained into me.\"[70] He has been critical of the Iraq War and UK government legislation in the area of civil liberties, in particular its plans to extend detention without charge to 42 days.
