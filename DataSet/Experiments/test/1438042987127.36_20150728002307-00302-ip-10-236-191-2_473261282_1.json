I won\u0027t talk I know that this book was written as a satire of communism, and I\u0027m sure that\u0027s been drilled into everyone\u0027s head a thousand times over. I won\u0027t talk about that; instead, I\u0027ll talk about what the books means to me. I skirted around reading this book for a while because the subject seemed like something I wouldn\u0027t be particularly interested in, but I was wrong. Animal Farm was started on an idea that was planted in the mind of the other animals by an old and respected farm figure -- Old Major. He had a dream that animals would take their place as the true heirs of the land. After Old Major dies, a revolution takes place on the farm, and the animals overthrow the owner, Mr. Jones, and claim the farm as their own. At first, things went as planned. All animals were equal, and many things were done with the good of the animals in mind. Then, the pigs (who were smarter than other animals, naturally) began to slowly warp this dream into something more cruel and deceitful until the animals can hardly distinguish between the pigs and Man. I think this story can apply to any form of government. The pigs kept the other animals in line by telling them what they wanted to hear or by using excessive force -- much like many governments in the world today. They twisted and warped the thoughts of the masses, making themselves look more heroic and \"for the masses\". They even had the scapegoat in the form of a banished pig named Snowball on which all their problems were blame. \"Blame Snowball\" seemed to be an underlying motto in the book. The pigs benefited from the prosperity of the farm while it\u0027s other inhibitants suffered. Most of the animals were fiercely loyal, and the pigs misused this trust. A great example is Boxer who worked harder than anyone on the farm, and when he was no longer useful to the farm, he was suddenly an expendable asset (and you can imagine what happens from there). And you can see hints of that in any society. I never expected to enjoy this book as much as I did, and it will definitely be a part of my library for years to come. ...more","review None","review None","review None","review None","review I listened to the audiobook up to chapter 3 last night and ended up reading the rest of it via eBook today.

The novel i In the winter of 1973, Susie Salmon, age 14, is raped and killed by her strange neighbor, Mr. Harvey, but Susie\u0027s story doesn\u0027t end there. The novel is told by Susie from Heaven as she continues to watch over everyone she loves--and those she doesn\u0027t love. Susie describes Heaven as being a place that caters to your whims -- your own personal heaven. Susie finds she can have anything she wants in Heaven except her life on Earth back. This turned out to be completely different from what I was expecting. I\u0027m not sure what I was expecting, but this definitely wasn\u0027t it. I was pleasantly surprised with the story. Even though, Susie is dead, she still seems to be going through typical adolescent behavior from Heaven. She dreams about first kisses and speaks on sex, but she no longer has the chance to experience those parts of life. So, she lives her life through her friends and family. Of course, Susie\u0027s family--her mother, her father, her brother, and her sister--are effected deeply by her death to the point that their family starts to crumble because of her death, but we\u0027re also shown the impact that her death had on her school crush, Ray, and a girl she barely knew, Ruth. It was interesting to see how her family dealt with it and how those outside her family dealt as well. But for all it\u0027s good points, there are some things that irked me. Some of the scene involving Ray and Ruth seemed to overshadow the main point. Susie\u0027s mother was very underdeveloped. While you could feel empathy for her father and siblings, you really couldn\u0027t do anything but dislike Susie\u0027s mother because you only saw one side of her. It was like she was a supporting character rather than one of the main characters. Also, The ending dragged a little longer than it should, and honestly, it left me feeling a little dissatisfied in regards to Mr. Harvey. Overall, good read, though.

The first chapter was sort of off-putting for me. In the begining the prose shifted between straight-forward and flowery, epic descriptions. Even the narrator, Cal, said his writing was Homeric and that it was genetic. But as Cal explain his history starting with his grandparents trials in the old country and their eventual move to America in the 20\u0027s, you become more and more involved with his story. We follow his grandparents (who were related) and his parents (who were also related) through their lives, watching what led up to what and who Cal was. We watch what shaped his relatives -- values from the old country, values from the new, war, racial tension, etc. So, the reader gets so much more than just a story about a hermaphrodite. You get to feel like you\u0027re a friend of the family. We\u0027re also treated to breaks where Cal talks about his budding relationship with a woman named Julie. By his own admission, Cal \"loves \u0027em and leaves \u0027em\". I don\u0027t even know what to say about this book really. It\u0027s fascinating.

All the mothers originally immigrated from China, and all have faced hardships and challenges, which have made them stronger and wish for something better for their American daughters while instilling in them Chinese values, but their daughters aren\u0027t living it up. They\u0027re facing their own problems as well, divorce, failure, shortcomings. This was a beautiful story about the complications between mother and daughters. While there are strong Chinese themes, any woman can look beyond this and maybe see their own relationship with their mother. There\u0027s so much unspoken between the mothers and daughters in this book. There are so many things they wish to tell each other, to make the other understand. There\u0027s a hazy gray area between them that they\u0027re trying to overcome. I really enjoyed this book. As I mentioned, it was beautiful. It showed the triumphs and failures of mother and daughter. It touched on the complexity of mother-daughter relationships, how what a mother wants for a daughter may not be the same thing the daughter wants for herself. In fact, there are many complex mother-daughter issues. And the story ends on a note that lets you decide if things got better or worse for the mothers and daughters. ...more","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review None","review Jesus, take the wheel.
