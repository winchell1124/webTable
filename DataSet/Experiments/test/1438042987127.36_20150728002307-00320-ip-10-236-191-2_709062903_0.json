He passed away quietly, surrounded by his wife and children. As soon as the news of the Bishops death was received at the Methodist Book Rooms, a meeting of the ministers was called for tomorrow morning. Arrangements for the funeral will be made and the ministers will probably decide to attend in a body. The Bishop will be buried Monday or Tuesday in the family lot at South Laurel Hill Cemetery. Bishop Simpson was born in Cadiz, Ohio, June 21, 1811. James Simpson, his father, was a native of the county of Tyrone, Ireland and in 1793, when only 13 years old, left his native country, in company with his parents and landed in Baltimore after a three month passage, during which the family had been captured by the British and been despoiled of nearly all their effects. They first settled in Huntingdon County, PA, then went to Pittsburg, and subsequently to Cadiz, Ohio. Afterwards, the family returned to Pittsburg. Matthew Simpson was educated at Cadiz Academy and parly at Madison College, PA. And after completing his collegiate education studied medicine and practiced for at short time. He was urged by his friends to enter the ministry and in 1833 was admitted to the Pittsburg Conference. Several years later, he removed to Monongahela City, where he remained until 1837, being in the meantime elected vice-president of Allegheny College and professor of natural science. In the spring of 1839, he was elected president of the Indiana Asbury University, which office he filled until 1848. In that year, he removed to Cincinnati for four years, having been chosen Western Christian Advocate. At the General Conference in Boston in 1844, when the church was distracted by the slavery question, the young minister won his first laurels as a strong thinker and able debater in the memorable discussion which was followed by the division of the Methodist Church. At the Boston Conference in 1852, he was chosen bishop, then being only three active bishops, Waugh, Morris and Janes. He was elected a delegate to the Irish and British Conferences by the General Conference at Indianapolis in 1856, and in 1857 attended the Irish Conference at Cork and the British Conference at Liverpool. From there he went to Berlin as a delegate to the Evangelical Alliance and then traveled through Europe, Asia, including the Holy Land and Egypt, from which tour he returned in 1858 so debilitated that he was unable to preach for a year. In 1859, he removed from Pittsburg to Evanston and became president of the Garret Biblical Institute. The question of establishing theological schools as a part of Methodist polity was then before the church, and Bishop Simpson accepted the presidency of this institution to give force to his own views in favor or this policy, which he advocated vigorously in speech and in writing. Bishop Simpson was an intimate friend of President Lincoln and Secretary Stanton and was among the first to advise the emancipation of the slaves when the war broke out. He was warmly interested in the restoration of the Union and the first Sunday after the capture of Fort Sumter, he preached in the Chicago wigwam upon the issues involved in the conflict. After President Lincolns assassination, he offered the prayer before the funeral procession started from the White House and delivered the address at Springfield, Ills, when the body was laid in the tomb. In June 1870, he went to Europe to complete the work of Bishop Kingsley and while there attended the German, Swedish, Norwegian and English Conferences. In 1874, he went to Mexico to assist in planting missions, and in 1875 again went to England, which he also visited a few years later. In September 1881, at a large meeting of Englishmen and Americans at Exeter Hall, held on account of President Garfields death, he delivered an address which moved the audience to enthusiastic demonstrations of applause. His ability as an orator was always felt. Whether it be a simple sermon of the Sabbath, or in the great effort of grand and noteworthy public occasions, his tall form, clear cut features, with shaven face and intellectual brow, commanded attention before a word was uttered. His voice was a power, supreme in itself, clear and musical, soft, yet powerful: he always made himself heard and was always heard with pleasure. Among Bishop Simpsons works are A Hundred Years of Methodism: and Lectures on Preaching. He was also the editor of the Cyclopedia of Methodism. Bishop Simpson married Miss Ellen H. Verner, of Pittsburg. One son survives him, Matthew Verner Simpson, of Philadelphia, and four daughters, one of whom is the wife of Col. James R. Weaver and another of Rev. C. W. Buoy. Bishop Simpson had been sick for several months. His system had been gradually giving way to the strain of work and the wear of years. In the first week of June he grew worse, and from that time on he gradually sank. When the late General Conference of the Methodist Church was in session during May, in Association Hall in Philadelphia, Bishop Simpson was so weak from the effects of the long illness which at last ended in his death that he was unable to participate actively in the public councils of the conference. He rose from a bed of sickness to be present at the opening ceremonies, was in attendance several times during the months meetings and at the final session made the closing speech. No man in the great quadrennial gathering composed of the representatives of the denomination was so deeply revered as he. His mere appearance in the hall was a signal for a greeting of applause. He was our beloved leader, said his fellow-bishops, and the sentence, voicing the thought of the whole conference expressed the feeling of the entire church. The name of Simpson was a magnetic word in every Methodist home. A bishop for over three decades of years, a prominent churchman for full half a century, he gained and held the esteem and admiration of his entire church, won fame in America as it recognized chief and became known the word over as a representative American and a powerful leader in the Protestant schools of theology.","SIMPSON, Ellen w/o Edward F Simpson and m/o James C and Mary E Fullis.

On Monday evening the young man started out in the company of his brother and two friends for the purpose of gunning a few miles from the city. They spent the day very pleasantly: nothing having transpired to disturb their enjoyment, when two of them toward evening, as they approached the Alms House discharged their leaded pieces at a flock of partridges and, sad to relate, Mr. Sisco, who had left the party and gone into the woods, contrary to the request of his brother, received several slugs with which one of the pieces was loaded, in the breast and throat. He immediately was conveyed to the residence of his sister in Mulberry Street, beyond Chatsworth, where his death ended his suffering at 8 O\u0027Clock in the evening, just two hours after he received the fatal wound.
